CHAT:CHAT MESSAGE: {'role': 'system', 'content': 'Hello! How can I assist you today?'}CHAT MESSAGE: {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Act as a summarizer. Your aim is to summarize an interview transcript so it can then be used for qualitative thematic analysis. You must remove all irrelevant information and keep everything that could be useful for thematic analysis. Make sure to keep details like professions, names of software, exact times of use and so on. Your summary must be 3 paragraphs long.\nThe interview is on the subject of user experience using the "Digimaps" software product developed by EDINA.\nInterview transcript:\n\n\n"1\nSo the interview will involve like 3 parts of questions.\n1\nSo the first part, could you tell me a bit about your research background and your experience with using\nthe map in terms of like what\'s involved in your research process and on the second part, we\'ll talk\nabout your typical test scenario.\n1\nSo what?\n1\nFeatures with specific functions would be involved in your research process or teaching process.\n1\nAnd thirdly, I will ask you about something or thoughts and your experience or any difficulties faced in\nusing digit map.\n1\nDoes that sound?\n1\nOK.\n2\nYes, absolutely.\n2\nYes, I\'ve not been using DG MAP.\n2\nOn my research that much I\'ve been using it maths more more often for for teaching purposes, more\nthan research purposes.\n1\nI see.\n1\nYeah, that\'s also great.\n1\nTeaching will also be great.\n1\nSo could you tell me a bit more about how it is involved in your rotation process or is it like you give\nassignments to people or is it like in a lab setting that there are tasks that you instruct them to do?\n2\nSo the way I use these map is quite basic.\n2\nBecause I\'m working at the at the.\n2\nSchool of architecture.\n2\nSo normally in our design courses we normally have to choose a side where the.\n2\nStudents are asked.\n2\nTo to design whatever it.\n2\nIs a building kind of building might be so.\n\n\nThe the the.\n2\nThe first reason why we mostly most in most of the design courses in that most of the of the other\nteachers and and and customizes, we\'ll use these map.\n2\nAs well is because.\n2\nWe like.\n\n\nTo ask.\n2\nStudents to charge.\n2\nFor asked them to download information as and most of the time well in my case I asked them to\ndownload information about the site and.\n2\nIn the form of this ordinance, survey maps and also some vector data, so.\n2\nMaps that they can use in in AutoCAD or or any any vectors or or in illustrator and and post produce\nafter that for doing site analysis.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo you mentioned that it will involve both them downloading the map itself as in like a print file and the\noriginal vector data.\n1\nIs that correct?\n3\nWell, that will involve also navigating.\n2\nThrough the areas where they are working.\n1\nRight.\n2\nAnd then they will need to choose.\n2\nTo to understand the.\n2\nCharacteristics the urban characteristics of the areas.\n2\nWhere they are working.\n1\nI see.\n1\nI see.\n1\nThank you.\n1\nAnd for the data files, what specifically would you need like the format in because I know that we offer\ndifferent data formats for like different types of data.\n1\nAnd have you?\n1\nDo you find it to be sufficient?\n1\nIs there like enough information that you can find?\n1\nOr is experience may be limited to the?\n1\nData file types that we offer so far.\n2\nWell, it depends on the size.\n2\nOn the geographical area where we are.\n2\nWorking so for the cases when we\'ve been working in locations which are based in the UK, the the the\ndetails of all the kinds of.\n2\nData we can find out absolutely.\n2\nWhereas sometimes, especially in the in the in the courses I teach, sometimes we work with other\nlocations outside, outside the UK, in in Europe or in other parts of the world.\n2\nAnd then it depends quite a lot.\n3\nOn the location.\n2\nWe are working so for example, last semester we\'ve been working.\n2\nIn in Paris, in France.\n2\nAnd the information for Paris is is quite good.\n2\nIn any case.\n2\nOne of the things we\'ve missed for Paris, for example, is the control lines.\n1\nI see.\n2\nUnderstand a little bit better the topography in a more kind of accurate way, which is something that\nthing is normally offer for for locations in the.\n2\nOK.\n2\nBut it\'s more difficult to find information about control lines and about the topography in in other\nlocations.\n\n\nOK.\n1\nI see because from my understanding we only have original service maps for the UK area.\n1\nSo was that within digit map as well or is it something like other collection like geology or?\n2\nWell, within Digi map there is this global.\n1\nOhh I see.\n2\nWhere there is a lot of information about locations in other places.\n2\nBut doesn\'t go through the ordinance survey.\n2\nThat\'s why the information available is is often less, less accurate.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo specifically the contour lines.\n2\nYes, I use a lot the global.\n2\nHow is it called?\n2\nI need to open it.\n2\nSorry I didn\'t.\n4\nHave time to no, it\'s alright.\n2\nRome or something like that.\n1\nOh, yeah, yeah, I think it is global room, yes.\n2\nThat\'s the yeah, we use that a lot.\n2\nYeah, this is the the global room.\n1\nOK.\n1\nThank you.\n1\nSo I\'ve heard that you would either download the data and import it into like the secondary softwares\nlike AutoCAD and or the maps that you download and print out so.\n1\nAfter like besides the exporting part, do you do any like annotation or drawing or line measurements\nwithin the digimap system at all?\n2\nI often use the the IMAP system.\n2\nTo to measure the dimensions of a site, in particular, at the beginning of the process of developing my\nmy, the, my the brief for my course, I often need to choose which sites I\'m going to offer the students\nwork in, and I need.\n2\nTo make sure that.\n2\nFor example, the sides have got all of them have put a similar dimension, things like that.\n2\nSo I often use the the the measure tool to to to measure the size.\n1\nI see it.\n1\nAnd how do you feel about our?\n1\nMeasurement tools.\n1\nIs it intuitively placed?\n1\nIs it difficult to use?\n2\nWell, it\'s it\'s quite intuitive and it\'s not fully accurate, but that sometimes I don\'t really need that\naccuracy.\n2\nSo I often just do a rough.\n2\nMeasure without.\n2\nI mean, yeah, I don\'t need.\n2\nUp that position.\n2\nAnd then when I download the the cut version is.\n2\nWhen I do the.\n2\nMore precise measurements, so I don\'t try to do very precise measurements within within the digimap.\n1\nI see.\n1\nYes, I see.\n1\nSo from my previous experience with interview other like teaching members of the university, they\nmentioned that they\'ve never used any function besides only downloading the data or the math.\n1\nAnd they only see digimap as a filing cabinet because there\'s other softwares that can do every other\ntask.\n1\nSo yes.\n1\nSo how often do you see like say for say for like a prop?\n1\nThat you have to put like 100% working preparing the task for students. How much time do you spend\nor how much effort do you spend in digimap versus other secondary softwares would you say?\n2\nWell, just I didn\'t spend much time in this e-mail, to be honest.\n4\nI see.\n2\nYeah, I just use it to, to to navigate to, to, to just find the the locations where I want to work sometimes\ndo this kind of very basic measurements to make sure that that\'s what I\'m there.\n2\nAfter I mentioned I want to.\n2\nThe one for that.\n2\nSite and then I just download the information and then of most of the time work with that information\noutside the the digimap, yes.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo is it like less than 5 minutes of work you would say?\n2\nOK, I will say is quite quite simple, yeah.\n4\nOK, I see. Thank you.\n2\nWell, what I probably spend more time on is especially when I\'m looking for some information of sites\nlocated outside the UK I.\n2\nLook through the different options of maps.\n2\nOur offer, just to make sure that I\'m downloading the map that has good information I require because\nthere are different versions of maps that can be downloaded.\n2\nBut that\'s probably most of my time spending this map is is on choosing the right kind of of map.\n2\nI\'m going to require to to download.\n4\nI see.\n1\nYeah, that that just reminds me of added question to that.\n1\nSo because that we I have also heard the students saying that because before you download the data\nyou have to select the area that you want the data to be in and you can only draw a shape or import like\na a previous shape that you drawn before.\n1\nBut have you ever faced any difficulties where you can\'t select the?\n1\nSpecific area that you wanted.\n1\nFor example, I want to select Scotland but there\'s no option for me to select Scotland or Edinburgh as a\ncity.\n1\nHas that ever been a difficulty for you?\n2\nWell, to me, yeah, it\'s not, I don\'t think.\n2\nI\'ve faced that question of.\n2\nTrying to select an area which cannot be selected as because it\'s probably to.\n2\nBe but what I\'m saying?\n2\nIs is the question.\n2\nSo about a priority.\n2\nI wouldn\'t know how big is going to be the.\n2\nApp I need to download for that.\n2\nParticular area I\'m interested.\n2\nIn and at a particular scale.\n2\nSo that\'s kind of it\'s kind of.\n2\nDifficult to understand.\n2\nHow big is the rectangular one? I need to draw to feed that map at a particular scale in an A3 for\nexample.\n2\nIn an H2.\n1\nI see.\n2\nThere\'s no option.\n2\nFor doing that for select.\n2\nThat a particular dimension according to a scale and a dimension of a paper.\n2\nSo that\'s something that I need to do outside the region.\n2\nMaybe that makes sense, yeah.\n1\nOh oh for my.\n1\nSo there\'s no like match between the coordinates and the scale, if that\'s correct.\n2\nAnd the scale?\n2\nYes, the scale of the paper.\n2\nAccording to the scale of the map.\n2\nSo I normally just try to draw a rectangle which is which is.\n2\nSimilar to what will be landscape.\n2\nAnd piece of paper adds what I\'m going that I\'m going to print or use at 83 or 82 and the scale is going to\nbe 1 to I don\'t know 500.\n3\nOr 1:00 to.\n2\n2000 whatever. But there\'s no way to understand the relationship between the scale of that piece of\nrectangle.\n2\nOr a piece of paper I\'m imagining.\n2\nAnd with this, the real scale is going to be at that.\n2\nFor that particular area.\n2\nIn that in that in that.\n2\nIn that particular channel.\n1\nI see it\'s.\n2\nIs that clear?\n2\nMore or less.\n1\nSo is that for the data download?\n1\nOr is it for the map printing?\n2\nThat\'s the for the moment when I.\n2\nSo the first.\n2\nAttempt to selecting that area for downloading.\n2\nI just need to make sure that I have good enough.\n2\nThat area selected for a particular dimension of a map.\n2\nI want to produce, and there\'s no way to understand that that well indeed, you know.\n2\nYou know what I mean?\n2\nSo I can, I can throw the rectangle.\n2\nBut I don\'t know whether that\'s going to be.\n2\nAnd Array 3, array 2 at the.\n2\nAt the scale of 1, the map to in.\n1\nOhh I see so it\'s.\n1\nOh, OK, let me try to describe it so that I make sure that I understand your problem.\n3\nFor doing.\n2\nThat that I haven\'t.\n2\nHaven\'t used, I don\'t know.\n1\nOK. So is it like so you can see the screen and you can draw a rectangle shape on the screen with that\nspecific scale, but you\'re not sure after you select that how big it will actually look on an A3 paper?\n2\nYes, yes, absolutely.\n1\nI see.\n1\nOK.\n1\nAnd I see and is that like a practical issue for giving assignments to students because they might have to\nprint out the area themselves as well?\n2\nSo they might need so one of the things that I do when I do the.\n2\nAssignment to students.\n2\nAnd I have got a conversation.\n2\nWith them.\n2\nI encourage to them to make sure that they always print out a rectangle which is slightly bigger than the\narea they are going to be required to analyze because sometimes.\n2\nThey just throw a random rectangle.\n2\nAnd there are very many interesting features.\n2\nThat lie outside that rectangle a lot, because don\'t fit the dimension of the piece of paper where they\nprint that out.\n2\nThey means very essential information, so it\'s it\'s kind of difficult to choose exactly what is the\ndimension and what kind of parts of the city around the site.\n4\nI see.\n2\nWhere they are working are going to be interested, interesting for them to.\n2\nTo look at.\n1\nYeah, that\'s an interesting problem.\n1\nThank you for bringing that up, yes.\n2\nAnd is that issue because?\n2\nWe don\'t do any three analysis of the area before downloading the area, so everything.\n2\nIs done out after afterwards.\n2\nSo we need to make.\n2\nSure that the area.\n2\nThe the, the, the.\n2\nPart of the of the of the map that has been downloaded contains all the information that needs to be\nanalyzed.\n1\nI see.\n1\nWell, OK.\n1\nSo adding up to the question after that.\n1\nI see that you give instructions for students in the task and how specific are the instructions?\n1\nAre is any of the instruction involved with like navigating through digimap or do they just start using it?\n2\nWell, in the past we have have.\n2\nDigital skills workshops.\n1\nOK.\n2\nAnd during the pandemic, we didn\'t.\n2\nPrerecorded it so.\n2\nWe used to show them how to navigate into digimap how to download things and all the basics of of\nhow to download something from from digimap and this.\n2\nYear I\'m trying to think about it because.\n2\nThis year that.\n2\nIn the first semester, I\'m.\n2\nI\'m this year I have been teaching only.\n2\nThe second semester.\n2\nAnd that has been done in the first semester, so I\'ve not been involved in that this year, but tribute\nyears.\n1\nI see.\n2\nWe\'ve done that, that.\n2\nWorkshop where we saw the students step by step how to navigate through the map and how to\ndownload that information.\n4\nI see.\n2\nSo I\'ve got that future doing that that.\n2\nWorkshop for us.\n1\nAnd afterwards the workshops.\n1\nAre there any like difficulties that students have report that you think that there\'s a pattern they\'re like,\nthey\'re mostly struggling with the same things in common?\n2\nWell, they often have struggled with finding.\n2\nInformation about sites which are located outside.\n2\nThe UK, as I said before.\n1\nI see.\n2\nBecause also depending on the size.\n2\nSome of them have got more.\n2\nYeah, have good, more information than others and.\n2\nOften they found it difficult to choose.\n2\nThe map they need to download and we are asking them to download and the to make sure that that\nmap that they are downloading contains all the information we\'re asking them to to look at and to one\nadvice.\n2\nBecause it\'s normally second year students.\n2\nThat start to do this work for the first time.\n2\nSo yeah, they are not that familiar with.\n2\nAnalyzing or on PlayStation things like that.\n2\nSo it\'s the first time they are.\n2\nDoing something like that.\n2\nSo that\'s probably, yeah, it\'s it\'s about finding exactly the kind of where are the data.\n2\nThat they need to.\n2\nDownload and and what is the kind of map we\'re asking them to download?\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo when you\'re talking about the different maps to download, are you talking about the base maps or\nmap overlays or map contents, or like the downloading section, the actual data?\n2\nWell, let me check.\n2\nSo we normally ask them to download.\n2\nDepending on the scale we are going to be.\n2\nWorking maps which contain the.\n2\nThe details at this scale we are.\n2\nGoing to be working at.\n2\nAnd vector maps, so maps that can be then exported into card.\n2\nSo but I.\n2\nDon\'t remember exactly depends.\n4\nI I can.\n2\nIt also depends on whether we are working with ordinance survey or with the global in other places.\n1\nI see. I\'m.\n2\nSo yes.\n1\nGonna share my screen if you can.\n3\nWe normally have.\n2\nTo just go to.\n2\nThe download data for TIS or cut?\n1\nOK.\n1\nCan you see my screen at the moment?\n1\nOK, because from my understanding that you select either OK if you zoom to a level up to here you can\nselect the vector map and oh it\'s the raster.\n1\nOK, so we are talking about the different map.\n1\nContents to download are you talking about like this part of the area or are you talking about like the\nmap content where you can like deselect and select rows and buildings.\n2\nSo yes, I normally asked him to.\n2\nDownload vector maps and then select the kind of aspects we are interested in.\n1\nOK.\n2\nSo we are normally interested in the build fabric, so in the buildings or the different activities within the\nbuildings then the roads are quite important for us as well.\n1\nOK.\n2\nAnd then as I said before the contour lines.\n2\nSo I normally asked them to download as much information as they can and then when they do the\nanalysis, they can then take off the information they don\'t need.\n2\nDepending on the map they are going to.\n2\nProduce, if that makes sense.\n2\nBut I would normally I normally recommend them to.\n2\nAs as much content as they can.\n1\nI see.\n2\nSo for example, in this case I will have asked them to download everything to tick everything and then\nselect.\n2\nThe the information they need afterwards, once they have got the the the information down.\n1\nI see.\n1\nAnd so how, how?\n1\nHow much would you say they\'re downloading the data versus the print map?\n1\nSo I see that you have to do some like secondary analysis and other softwares, but for maps you can\nonly like draw.\n1\nOn them, after you download them so.\n1\nIs it really?\n1\nImportant for them to download the map as how it looks as well as the data itself.\n2\nYes, they need, yes.\n2\nSo they will need to download the map as it loop itself because they need to be able to understand the\nmap and to understand the information.\n2\nBut then what is important for us is that they analyze that information.\n2\nSo, for example, that they can create then a map of the density of the fabric, or the amount of the\ntopography, or so that they need to, they need to be able to then.\n2\nStruct just a few of the of the.\n2\nAspects of that map.\n2\nSo but yeah, I I think that it\'s both things are important.\n2\nSo it\'s important for us that they understand everything together and that they can see the map as it is\nand as.\n2\nIt looks like.\n2\nAnd then that will be the 2nd.\n2\nThe second part of the process is that is to start to analyze it in in light in layers.\n2\nI will say you\'re in different for different aspects.\n2\nOf the of the map.\n1\nI see.\n1\nI see.\n1\nAnd when you mentioned that you were not sure about how the rectangle was going to look in the\nactual paper, are you talking about the map printing?\n1\nOr the data downloading.\n1\nI\'m sorry, I think you\'re frozen a bit.\n1\nBecause of the connection.\n2\nSorry I I think I have.\n2\nAn issue with my.\n4\nNetwork. That\'s alright. Yes, you.\n2\nWell, yeah, I cannot see your screen now, but I think that was interesting because it\'s I think it\'s in both\ncases.\n2\nSo for example that.\n2\nImage yes, in this one I will see.\n2\nSo this is you can see that the page size is a four and the scale is is 1 to 1.\n2\nBut they don\'t know whether that\'s going to just fit the whole of the A four page or or that that there is\nsome data that is going that\'s going to stand beyond the DA four page.\n1\nI see.\n2\nSo yeah.\n1\nSo you would now like, probably zoom out from the map a bit to.\n\n\nYes, so that.\n2\nNeeds to be slightly adjusted.\n1\nI see.\n2\nAccord the the aspects of the area around where they are working.\n2\nThey are interested in sitting.\n1\nI see and.\n2\nFor example, if there is something.\n2\nI don\'t know and.\n2\nI will say another village.\n\n\nOr or whatever or.\n2\nA shopping center with slights.\n2\nTo the outside, the the area they have previously selected, they will need to adjust the dimension\nslightly so they don\'t need to play with that a few times in order to make sure that everything they have\nselected is what they with the required to do the.\n1\nAnalysis I see and has that been a problem in the download as well?\n1\nSo you have.\n1\nTo like select.\n1\nMore a bigger area than just this park in town as well.\n2\nYes, that will apply both to the to the, to the map, to the printed original version of the map, and to the\ndata with the downloaded.\n2\nSo really both things we need to match.\n1\nYeah. OK.\n2\nAnd they.\n2\nWill once they download.\n2\nThe data.\n2\nSo for example the card data.\n2\nWe often have a wider area around the selected rectangle depending on how the data have been\nproduced.\n2\nSo then we need to again redo their their rectangle once they they they they export that into cut.\n1\nSo I see.\n1\nSo there is a bit going back and forth.\n1\nTo like adjust the area that you actually want.\n2\nThat\'s just the area, yes.\n1\nI see.\n2\nThat\'s probably one of the most difficult is for for them to to to make sure that they are downloading\nthe area that is required.\n2\nFor the analysis.\n1\nI see.\n1\nYes, thank you so much for explaining this part.\n1\nNow I feel like I completely understand the problem so.\n3\nIs, well, one of the reasons for that is now that I\'m looking at the screen, which.\n2\nIs, I think quite.\n2\nUseful is that the zoom in and out they do in the map.\n2\nFor example, now this we are seeing.\n2\nThis map at 1/2.\n2\nI don\'t know what the.\n2\nScale will be, but there\'s 200 metres.\n2\nLike is is that size.\n2\nAnd they when they download it, they think that that\'s the scale they are going to be downloading the.\n2\nMap app and it\'s not.\n2\nSo one thing is what they can see in the map by zooming in and out and something different.\n2\nIs the scale they are downloading the map app.\n2\nAnd the both the scales can be different.\n2\nThat\'s why probably is is sometimes confusing for them to understand the difference.\n2\nThe map they are seeing so mean and out the scale of that map and the scale.\n2\nOf the download.\n1\nI see. Oh, so like, even if I\'m looking at a 1 to 200 meters map right now and when I try to download it, it\nwill jump to another scale, is that correct?\n2\nYes. For example, when.\n2\nYou when you are trying to print it.\n2\nThat scale?\n2\nYes, exactly that scale would be different.\n2\nTo the map you\'re seeing, yeah.\n1\nOh, I see. And it doesn\'t even allow a number that is less than 1000.\n1\nSo has that been a problem?\n1\nFor the students that they can zoom into a very like detailed scale to print out the map.\n2\nWell, they can.\n2\nThey can zoom in into a very detailed scale, so it\'s not the problem is not that they cannot zoom in.\n2\nThe problem is more that they need to understand the difference between what they see on the screen.\n2\nBefore trying to print it and the scale they are printing it out.\n4\nI see. I see.\n2\nSo it\'s about understanding more how the how the system works in, in, in terms of the of the scales,\nbecause that this preview doesn\'t have a scale on it.\n2\nNo. Yeah, so so.\n2\nOnce they print it, they.\n2\nThen realize.\n2\nOh, really, that\'s not the scale I was looking for.\n2\nYes, exactly.\n1\nI see.\n1\nOK.\n1\nI see.\n1\nYeah, that\'s interesting.\n4\nPoint I\'ve never actually realized that.\n4\nOK, thank you.\n1\nOK, I see.\n1\nAnd I\'ve noticed that there\'s a help page right here and previous interviews.\n1\nBasically, nobody has noticed it or used it before and after they click on it and they realize that ohh,\nthere\'s so much helpful information on there that they could just like look at and probably not struggle\nabout them anymore and has that been an important part of the instructions in.\n1\nThe assignments for students for you.\n2\nFor me, I\'ve used that I\'ve used that, so I I normally I\'m I\'m quite used to using the the help in All in all\nsoftwares.\n2\nSo I\'ve used that a little bit, especially for understanding what kind of data I can download at the\nbeginning when I.\n2\nStarted to use.\n2\nIt and for these students we normally when we introduce.\n2\nBecause in these digital workshops we introduce lots of different supports and we normally encourage\nthem to to use that help or our extra info option.\n2\nAnd but I I cannot remember 100% because I was not the person delivering this work. So I had that\nfuture delivering the workshop, and I\'ve been normally there just helping with the procedure and and\nanswering two questions. So I don\'t exactly remember.\n2\nWhether we will.\n2\nIntroduce this, but we normally ask them.\n2\nTo first try to solve that issue their problem by looking at the at the help center within that software and\nthen if they cannot solve that issue, then they they they can come back to us and let us know if they still\nhave have got any issues.\n2\nSo we normally do that.\n2\nIn this particular case, I don\'t remember whether we introduced it or not.\n1\nYeah, yeah.\n1\nBecause you would think that it\'s pretty obvious for students to know.\n1\nNotice that.\n1\nBut like in every single interview that I have had so far, they\'ve not used it.\n1\nSo I\'m really, I\'m really glad to hear that.\n2\nYeah, I mean, we normally we always encourage them to use that.\n2\nAnd in the case of of Digi Maps, there\'s so much information out there and and open St.\n2\nMaps and all that, there\'s really a lot a huge amount of information out there.\n2\nSo yeah.\n2\nBut yeah, it\'s always, it\'s always difficult.\n1\nWell, thank you for sharing this information.\n1\nI think I\'ve almost got all the questions I wanted to ask and it\'s just like a final usability scale that I will\nshare it with you.\n1\nAnd could you give me a rating?\n1\nFor each question and a reason for why you gave that rating.\n1\nIf possible please can you see the scale OK?\n1\nYes, and UM, yeah. Could you just give me a score for each question and explain why you give that\nscore, please?\n2\nOK, I think I would like to use this system frequently.\n2\nSo do you mean that the the this system do you mean the digimap?\n1\nOh yes.\n1\nSo this questionnaire was not designed specifically for digit map, but all the questions I would like you to\nanswer in the scope of.\n1\nDigit map please.\n2\nOK for the Dima.\n2\nYes, yes, I agree that I.\n2\nWould like to to use.\n2\nIt frequently and I and I use it frequently.\n2\nWhen I.\n2\nStart a new.\n2\nBrief or yeah, even even in the future, once they start the new research, I probably need to to use it\nquite frequently.\n2\nSo yeah, I I strongly agree you can.\n1\nOK.\n2\nFor first question I will say five.\n2\nYes, I found the system unnecessarily complex.\n2\nI strongly disagree.\n2\nI I find it quite easy to understand.\n2\nProbably it\'s probably because I\'ve used.\n2\nIt is very basic tools I\'ve not used.\n2\nProbably the most complex options, but I don\'t find it difficult to to understand.\n1\nThank you.\n2\nThen the third one.\n2\nI thought the system was easy to use.\n2\nWell, it\'s been it to me.\n2\nIt\'s been simple to use.\n2\nFrom the beginning, because I use a little bit of GIS before I see.\n3\nIt\'s a father.\n3\nI\'ve been downloading.\n2\nMaps in other from from other services in in in other countries so.\n2\nI didn\'t find it particularly difficult to use.\n2\nI think it\'s it\'s the basics are are simple and easy to to use.\n2\nSo I will say and I strongly disagree on that one as well.\n2\nSo I don\'t think.\n2\nIt\'s it\'s I.\n2\nDidn\'t think was more was going.\n2\nTo be more easy to use, OK.\n1\nI see.\n2\nThing that I.\n2\nWill need to support the support of a technical person to be able to.\n2\nUse this system.\n2\nNo, absolutely not so.\n3\nProbably if I if I use.\n2\nMuch more if I ever need to use much more complex tools, it will be really useful to have someone\nexplaining that a little bit more, but I don\'t think I will need.\n2\nTechnical Support.\n2\nAs for the kind of things I I I do at the moment and I.\n2\nNeed that. OK, I see.\n2\nI found the various functions in this system were well integrated and well have not explored many\ndifferent functions.\n2\nFirst no.\n2\nAnd the functions have explored are well integrated.\n2\nI will say yes.\n2\nThey are well integrated.\n2\nI thought there was too much inconsistency.\n2\nNo, I haven\'t found.\n1\nYeah, I see.\n1\nSo would that be a one like a strongly disagree.\n2\nI strongly disagree.\n1\nYes, I see.\n1\nOK, got it.\n3\nI will imagine.\n2\nThat most people.\n2\nWill learn to use this system very quickly.\n2\nI think that it requires probably.\n2\nPrevious knowledge a little bit about understanding of scale, understanding of.\n2\nMaps in general and the content of maps.\n2\nUnderstanding of how to translate the difference between row and vector and and and and and cluster\nand maps and all that.\n2\nSo I don\'t think it\'s very intuitive for people that probably are external to that knowledge for.\n2\nI would imagine that most people will learn the.\n2\nI disagree with that, yes.\n1\nWould that be of strongly disagree?\n1\nOr would that be like a two or?\n2\nProbably like, yes, probably at 2, yes.\n1\nI see. Thank you.\n2\nI don\'t think.\n2\nIt\'s particularly difficult in general, but I think it requires.\n2\nPeople especially.\n1\nLike prior knowledge.\n2\nYeah, for for my second year students.\n2\nI think it\'s more difficult to to use it, that it is for me.\n2\nSo I think that it requires some some pre knowledge and spatial issues in general, yeah.\n1\nI see. Thank you.\n2\nI found the system very.\n2\nCumbersome to use.\n2\nWhat do you mean about that?\n2\nIt\'s in particular.\n1\nLike there\'s too much drag like you have to do a lot of extra things in order to get one thing done.\n1\nFor example for downloading maps and you have to like go through all these extra things.\n1\nIf that makes sense.\n2\nWell, I think it\'s it requires.\n2\nTo use.\n2\nTo understand the complexity probably.\n2\nSo it\'s probably something a little bit unavoidable to to to the the the little, yeah, the little complexity\ninvolved in in doing these things.\n2\nBut I don\'t think it\'s.\n2\nReally, really complex too, too complex.\n2\nI will say that it\'s.\n2\nIt\'s probably we\'re also expecting it to be so.\n2\nI will say three.\n2\nI don\'t agree or disagree.\n2\nI think is what I was expecting.\n4\nOK, call that.\n2\nI feel very confident with using the system.\n2\nI will say.\n2\n4 So I feel confident, but I\'ve.\n2\nNot explored.\n2\nVery complex options, so I\'m.\n4\nI see.\n\n\nVery that I\'m very confident.\n1\nSo confident with what you\'re using right now.\n2\nI needed to learn a lot of things before I could get.\n2\nGoing with the system.\n1\nSo a lot of things here would probably.\n1\nMean the knowledge in GIS, yes.\n2\nYeah, well, The thing is that because I started using it.\n2\nAfter graduating and so yeah, because I\'m quite old so.\n2\nWhen I graduated with and have this kind of.\n2\nThis technology I started without without the Internet so.\n3\nI didn\'t probably realize.\n2\nThat have required a lot of blur of pre learning because they just learn probably within a very long\nperiod of time all these.\n4\nI see.\n2\nThings, but I.\n2\nThink it requires.\n2\nTo to learn a little bit before so, but it was not particularly.\n2\nSo it required learning, but not it was not particularly to to.\n2\nI didn\'t.\n2\nI didn\'t have to do any extra learning before I could get going with the system, so I from the first day I I\ntried I.\n2\nCould just download some data.\n1\nI see.\n2\nSo more than probably learning it requires.\n2\nProbably a little bit of familiarity with the system, I will say rather than extra learning.\n1\nI see.\n2\nOK, so.\n2\nI need to learn, so I will say probably A2I disagree. I don\'t think it requires a lot of learning, it\'s more like\nfamiliarity than than learning in yeah.\n1\nOK, I see that\'s a really good point.\n1\nFamiliarity versus actual learning.\n4\nThank you.\n2\nBecause all these systems are somehow similar but also.\n2\nThe setup and the organization of the tools and all that can be a little bit different, so it requires a little\nbit of understanding in general, yeah.\n1\nI see.\n1\nWell, thank you for giving me all those answers.\n1\nIt\'s been really helpful and I\'ve gotten a lot of information from the conversation.\n1\nThank you very much again.\n1\nAnd before we move on to like our days and I just wanted to ask, has there been any question that I\ndidn\'t bring up?\n\n\nThank you.\n1\nJust now that you thought about it before, like using during the your use for digital map.\n2\nWell, no, I cannot think of any other.\n2\nAny other things?\n2\nYeah, because probably because I do a very kind of simple and straightforward use of that so.\n\n\nOK.\n2\nI can\'t think of any any other things.\n1\nOK, great.\n1\nWell, thank you so much again for coming to the interview and.\n1\nThank you so much for all these answers and I like took so much notes and well, if they\'re.\n2\nHow many people have been interfering?\n1\nOh, I\'ve done 12 so far and for the coming week there\'s another nine or eight, eight or nine, yes.\n2\nI mean, do you have enough people already?\n4\nYes, I do.\n4\nYes, yes, thank you.\n4\nWell if.\n\n\nLike we thought, we thought that.\n1\nThank you for helping me with this.\n1\nIf there is anything that I could help you, although I kind of doubt if I can, but if there\'s anything that I\ncan do for you, I\'ll please just let me know.\n4\nThere\'s anything.\n2\nYes, please feel free to just send me the results on on your research because it\'s.\n4\nYes, I will.\n2\nWhere do you end up?\n2\nDoing with this?\n2\nAnd I think in any case, I think it\'s a, it\'s a really.\n2\nIt\'s a really great program.\n2\nAnd it\'s really super useful to have it.\n2\nSo yeah, great.\n1\nThank you so much.\n2\nLuck with that.\n1\nYes, thank you.\n1\nI hope you have a rest.\n1\nGood rest every day.\n1\nThank you.\n1\nYou too.\n1\nThank you."\n\n\nBegin!'}CHAT MESSAGE: {'role': 'system', 'content': 'During the interview, the participant discussed their experience with using the "Digimaps" software product developed by EDINA. They mentioned that they primarily use it for teaching purposes rather than research. They explained how they use the maps in their design courses at the School of Architecture. Students are asked to download information about a site, such as survey maps and vector data, for site analysis in software like AutoCAD or Illustrator. The participant mentioned that the availability and accuracy of data can vary depending on the location, and they sometimes face challenges in selecting the specific area they want to download or print on a map. They also discussed the use of measurement tools in the software and the importance of students understanding the scale and dimensions of the maps they are working with. Overall, the participant found the system easy to use and did not require extensive technical support. They expressed confidence in using the system and mentioned that familiarity with GIS and maps in general is helpful in navigating and understanding the software.'}
