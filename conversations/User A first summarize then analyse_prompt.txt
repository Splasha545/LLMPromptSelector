Make sure to keep the main points made by the speakers. Save the exact quotes for the main points. The speakers are denoted by a number on a previous line (Note in this conversation speaker 2 and speaker 3 are the same person).\n\nConversation transcript:\n"1\nSome information, but just so you know.\n1\nOK, so.\n2\nOK.\n1\nLet me just I have a list of questions you don\'t have to answer any of them if you don\'t want to, OK.\n1\nAnd you can stop this at any time.\n1\nOK.\n1\nAnd then if you don\'t want your answers to be recorded, uh, we can also take that out from the final results.\n1\nOK.\n1\nSo first of all, are you accessing digit map through University of Edinburgh?\n1\nYeah. OK. Is it like?\n1\nSo you are undergraduate student.\n1\nLike what?\n1\nWhat course gives you that app?\n3\nSo there were a few courses that I used this for and one was.\n3\nIt\'s like architectural heritage, like related costs and we need it kind of like old maps study.\n3\nAnd also there was some.\n3\nLike technology related goals, but also like architecture and.\n3\nWell, no, actually not.\n3\nIt was like actual design course.\n3\nI mean like information of the site, OK, of the buildings that we designed, yeah.\n1\nSo from my understanding the first part the did you use historic for the first?\n3\nYeah, a historic.\n3\nAnd also I think.\n3\nLike a new one, I think.\n1\nOhh, nice.\n1\nYou wanted that survey.\n1\nOK, so it\'s actually the focus on this interview.\n2\nOK.\n1\nSo that\'s great that you use that so.\n1\nOhh what year are you in?\n3\nFinished second, yes, I guess.\n1\nSo in coming third year for architecture.\n1\nArchitecture history.\n1\nOK.\n1\nSo that\'s your.\n1\nName the major.\n3\nWell, it\'s actually called architecture, history and heritage, but same thing.\n1\nOK, OK, got it. So.\n1\nHave you had, like, research projects that you\'ve requires you to use it?\n1\nOr is it majority like assignments for labs, etcetera?\n3\nSo it was kind of.\n3\nKind of an independent like project.\n3\nSo I did like my individual project for the.\n3\nCourse yeah.\n3\nSo it.\n3\nSo it\'s like we got assigned like a one note, we have like several sides to choose from to focus on and then?\n3\nWe did like individual research on the site, so yeah.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo it\'s like an assignment, but then the process of the assignment is research.\n3\nYeah, yeah.\n1\nI see so.\n1\nWere there any like clear instructions for like OK step?\n1\nOne open the step two.\n1\nDo that and that.\n3\nLet me think.\n1\nOr it was just like completely?\n1\nExploratory on your own.\n3\nIt actually so like when I did that course, I already used this map my first year course on actual design.\n1\nOhh nice.\n3\nSo I don\'t think I have some kind of very like clear step by step instruction for my like heritage course for the year 2.\n3\nYeah, I don\'t think there was like very like clear structure for that.\n3\nBut when I was in year one, yeah, I think there was some kind of instruction.\n\nOK.\n3\nYeah, I think that was online because it was still like 8 years ago.\n1\nYeah, right.\n3\nYeah, but there was something that, yeah, helped us, like, setting up the account and, yeah, go to this spot.\n3\nBut still I felt like I needed to explore a bit like by myself to like find out like.\n3\nHow I can like download things and yeah.\n1\nOK.\n1\nHow would you describe the process?\n1\nWas it like OK to use?\n1\nWas it confusing?\n1\nWere there anything that in particular that you couldn\'t find?\n3\nI guess I was like, OK to do like what I wanted to do.\n3\nSo at first it was a bit like I felt confusing because there are like so many functions that I can use.\n3\nHow to?\n3\nSo like.\n3\nDo exactly what I want.\n3\nTo do, yeah, but.\n3\nI guess I just like explode and that was OK.\n3\nIt might feel a bit like difficult for some people, I guess, and.\n3\nYeah, well, I guess.\n3\nBecause there are just so many functions, it\'s very difficult to like make it.\n1\nRight.\n3\nLike somehow, like.\n1\nMore straightforward.\n3\nYeah, yeah.\n1\nOK, sorry that has been a very abstract question, but like so for example, what specific task were you asked to do?\n3\nSo I needed to download a map from the survey, OK and.\n\nOK.\n3\nFor like specific.\n3\nLike the like 1 to like, right? Yeah. 5000 or like whatever and.\n\nOK.\n1\nIs it OK if you like show me the process?\n3\nOK, I I will try because that\'s.\n3\nYou do?\n3\nI will try, yeah.\n1\nYeah, just like, imagine this is your.\n1\nLaptop you\'re starting from scratch completely right?\n1\nSo first.\n1\nOf all search.\n1\nOK.\n1\nCould you just like talk?\n3\nMe through. Ohh yeah so.\n\nThank you.\n3\nIf I opened like this, show them up right and I think I usually check.\n1\nWait, I\'ll do a screen recording, yeah.\n1\nOK. Thank you.\n3\nAnd I think I usually like, I don\'t remember like which part like includes like which function, but I just like move through those things and then see.\n1\nSo it\'s like every time you do something new, you still have to go back to every.\n3\nOhh, maybe maybe if when I\'m doing like 1 project I remember well.\n1\nOf these functions.\n3\nBut like yeah because it\'s been like a few months, right?\n1\nUh, so there are the drawing tools, yeah.\n3\nSo I so I did stuff about like Edinburgh, so I\'ll just like from the area.\n2\nOK.\n1\nOK, OK.\n1\nAnd so basically zoom into the area and then?\n3\nYeah, I think I\'ve used uh.\n3\nThis one before.\n3\nI don\'t really remember.\n\nTake your time.\n1\nYeah, there\'s too many like tools to select.\n\nRight.\n\nFrom this.\n3\nYeah, I think I did this thing before.\n3\nYeah, I just.\n3\nThis kind of shape and stuff like the side that I.\n1\nOK.\n3\nWant to focus on?\n3\nOK.\n3\nDoes it have to?\n3\nBe exact.\n3\nOK, just make OK.\n3\nOK.\n1\nWe\'re trying to like redo or undo.\n3\nIt changed like I was just thinking if I can change the thickness of the line.\n1\nOh, thickness.\n3\nYeah, I forgot how.\n3\nTo do it I.\n3\nJust like explode.\n3\nAnd then I know how to do it.\n2\nOK.\n3\nThen I remember I we do things.\n3\nBut yeah, how did I do?\n3\nNo boy.\n2\nOK.\n1\nOh, yes. OK, nice.\n1\nNice, all cleared.\n3\nAnd what should I do?\n3\nI think I didn\'t really use.\n3\nThese kind of things.\n3\nYeah, download.\n3\nYeah, I usually print from this and.\n2\nOK.\n3\nJust yeah, check the scale here I guess.\n1\nOK.\n3\nThen generate print file.\n3\nCan I generate it now or?\n1\nYeah, yeah, of course, of course.\n1\nOK, so it\'s downloaded.\n1\nSo basically I\'m trying to like paraphrase what you just did there.\n1\nSo first of all, you zoom into the area that you wanted to download and then you selected it and like threw out and during the process you had some like figure out to do.\n3\nHmm yeah.\n1\nYeah, but then basically.\n1\nYou try to print.\n1\nThe picture?\n1\nYeah, because I noticed that you came here for download.\n1\nSo, like, did you did you any of the tasks ever included, like downloading the actual data instead of the map?\n3\nNo, I was always just downloading the map, not the data.\n3\nOK, so that\'s why I.\n3\nFelt unfamiliar with the thing.\n3\nWhen I fix it, yeah.\n1\nRight, right.\n1\nRight.\n1\nAlso because there\'s a lot of functions here, as you said, there\'s like all sorts of face maps and all sorts of overlays.\n3\nOh yeah, yeah.\n1\nDid you ever use these kind of functions during?\n1\nAny of your accounts.\n3\nI might have checked this one, it\'s not maybe like full like specific purposes.\n3\nI was just like trying to explore what kind of maps they have and maybe some other maps looks they look better than others.\n1\nRight.\n3\nAnd I\'ve, yeah, I\'ve used like historic months before, but that\'s I think in a different.\n1\nOK.\n1\nRight section, right.\n1\nSo so basically you export the base masks on your own, but there is no clear instruction in terms of like school assignments or projects which maps you should use.\n3\nAs far as I can remember, like there was a.\n3\nLike instruction about like how to get to like this part like all the registration and stuff right, but not too much about the map itself.\n3\nOK and.\n1\nSo it didn\'t specify like whatever map worked.\n3\nI think so, yeah, especially.\n3\nFor like the work that I.\n3\nThat was like focus was more on, like using historic maps.\n3\nSo like they\'re using phrasing.\n1\nOhh I see.\n3\nMap was just like kind of referenced.\n3\nSo they didn\'t really specify anything and so like my year one like architecture design course, they might have specified like some.\n2\nOK.\n3\nNo, this one maybe.\n3\nMaybe it was like this one, but it was, I think, more kind of like design rather.\n1\nOK.\n3\nLike some specific function of each map.\n1\nOK.\n1\nYeah, I see.\n1\nI see.\n1\nOK, great.\n1\nYou for showing me.\n1\nJust some general questions now so.\n1\nSo so overall, if you think of like all the tasks that was that were requiring you.\n1\nTo use the app.\n1\nCould you give me a summary of like the category of tasks?\n1\nBecause you mentioned historic right and you mentioned design, yeah.\n1\nAnd you mentioned some maps are just for comparison.\n3\nSo all the tasks that I\'ve done are all related to like buildings.\n3\nSo architecture.\n3\nSo we need like information on where it like.\n3\nSo that\'s usually the reason that we need maps.\n3\nSo for location.\n3\nAnd also when I was using historic maps maps that was to see the change of the site over time, I guess so yeah, that was a.\n1\nLike main purpose to use them up.\n1\nAnd what?\n1\nWhat was the rest of the question?\n1\nJust like what what categories and tasks would you think like what are the purposes of those tasks?\n1\nSo you mentioned comparisons, yeah you mentioned.\n1\nJust to view the location.\n3\nSo maybe the context of like all the things that I study about, like buildings.\n3\nOK.\n1\nOK. OK, great. So.\n1\nSo from your experience of using it.\n1\nHave you found?\n1\nBecause I\'ve noticed the drawing took of you were confusing.\n3\nYeah, yeah.\n1\nWhat other difficulties have you faced?\n1\nWas there this really frustrating moment that you were?\n1\nJust like can\'t.\n1\nFigure out for like an hour straight.\n3\nDon\'t remember in that particular moment.\n3\nI feel like I really want to.\n3\nDo something but.\n3\nI can\'t, but I just.\n3\nKind of like felt like there must be like, more functions that I can make use of, right?\n3\nBut because just like, there are so many things there, I can\'t really figure out like what I can.\n3\nDo right to like do something better so.\n3\nYeah, it would be useful if, like there\'s.\n3\nLike nicely clear introductory video or something like kind of go through like all the things that.\n3\nI can do but just.\n1\nLike training.\n3\nSo yeah, it\'s like nothing like particular that I struggled.\n3\nBut I just feel like I\'m not like making the.\n3\nMost of it, yeah.\n1\nSo it\'s just like a.\n1\nIceberg a.\n1\nOK.\n1\nBecause I feel the same.\n1\nHonestly, I didn\'t know anything about.\n1\nThis time and I have to like.\n1\nExplore on yeah, so.\n1\nI feel.\n1\nI I I can feel from.\n1\nYour description that there.\n1\nAre so many personalities to this man.\n3\nYeah, yeah.\n3\nAnd I\'m only seeing this part.\n\nRight.\n1\nSo what\'s your sense of the other functionalities that may be able to achieve?\n1\nSo what do you think is the purpose of this digimap.\n3\nI guess that.\n3\nWould be like mainly for like research purposes right of like places so.\n3\nI guess maybe like extracting like some like specific like things about them up and then?\n3\nPutting like specific things together onto like warm up and then like create your own like thing that you can use to illustrate your point or I don\'t know.\n3\nLike maybe that kind of thing can be possible I.\n3\nDon\'t really know.\n1\nSo you\'re feeling like it\'s more for research than for, like undergraduate assignments?\n3\nWell, yeah, I guess.\n3\nWell, maybe because like my assignment like.\n3\nLike that many times.\n3\nSo it\'s not, it\'s.\n3\nThis car, like a lot of the room, right, like can like, explore freely so.\n3\nYeah, and.\n3\nMaybe like for like dissertation or those kind?\n3\nOf like big works.\n3\nThat like you need to.\n3\nLike Expo information, rather than like getting things possibly so like, I think it\'s very it\'s really like useful to to like find out something.\n3\nIs not.\n3\nLike already there.\n3\nAnd I don\'t know like in like.\n3\nWhere they made.\n3\nLike image or something on the Internet cause you can like really explore stuff so yeah.\n3\nSo basically we.\n1\nPick because it\'s such a huge iceberg.\n3\nYeah, yeah.\n1\nThere\'s so many things you can just like play.\n3\nAround I think, and not only for like maybe like studies, maybe you can just use like explore things and then use for?\n3\nI don\'t know when you like, be there somewhere or it can be quite useful because you help lift them up.\n2\nOK.\n3\nLike with maps, yeah.\n1\nYeah, yeah, I see.\n1\nSo you you mentioned the part where you think that like a introduction video would be helpful.\n1\nHave you ever tried to look at the help pages?\n3\nNot for this map, only this map side or like on like University of Edinburgh.\n1\nYeah. Yeah, like on.\n1\nThe website ohh.\n3\nI might have like a long time ago, but not recently and.\n3\nYou know.\n1\nWhere it is.\n3\nI don\'t know.\n3\nOh yeah.\n3\nHelp page.\n3\nOh, that\'s a very, like, sleek, nice page.\n1\nYeah, it is.\n1\nIt actually looks like.\n3\nLearning materials.\n1\nTo never realize that that\'s.\n3\nNo, I didn\'t realize because it looked.\n3\nLike very tiny.\n3\nI thought it\'s.\n3\nIt\'s like, it\'s not like that important but.\n2\nExactly the same.\n3\nBut it\'s like it\'s actually really like nicely treated and wow.\n2\nOK.\n3\nI should I should have.\n2\nOK.\n2\nOK.\n2\nInteresting to hear that.\n2\nOK.\n1\nI think there just be some final questions left.\n1\nSo if you were to rate on this sheet, could you give me a rating for each of the questions and then explain why?\n1\nYou gave the.\n3\nRating would like to use this system.\n3\nYeah, I think so.\n3\nBecause I.\n3\nWow, that\'s a win for.\n3\nYou think it\'s really like, nice, like, great service.\n3\nUh, you can, like, use for free.\n3\nOK, so.\n3\nI found the system unnecessarily.\n3\nIt\'s not unnecessarily complex.\n3\nIt\'s complex, but it\'s, I guess like it\'s reasonable.\n3\nOK, I thought the system was easy to use.\n3\nI\'ll go for neutral because.\n1\nOK.\n3\nIt\'s not like so unnecessarily difficult, but yeah.\n1\nIt\'s difficult.\n\nCuz there\'s so.\n1\nMuch stuff.\n3\nYeah, OK, I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.\n3\nWell, because now I know that there are some materials available, maybe I can do it by myself.\n3\nOK, yeah.\n1\nBut before you didn\'t.\n3\nUh, no, I well.\n3\nI I you shouldn\'t even be like just like.\n3\nExplore, but that does take time, so I will go for.\n1\nOK, makes.\n3\nSense I found the various functions in the system were well integrated.\n3\nI\'m not that expert in the system, so I thought there was too much inconsistency.\n3\nIn this system.\n3\nI don\'t think there are too many, but maybe it\'s just because I.\n3\nThey didn\'t know like that much.\n1\nSo there was some.\n1\nBecause you like giving out.\n3\nAh, no, I.\n3\nDidn\'t really find it, so yeah, there might have been, but I didn\'t really notice.\n3\nI was like very beginner user.\n1\nIs it because they\'re hard to notice?\n1\nOr is it because you just haven\'t used it that much to notice?\n3\nI think it\'s because I\'ve only used like a few functions.\n3\nI guess if you use like more and the various functions.\n3\nI might have like noticed ohh this and this are like very similar kind of in the same.\n3\nOh but I yeah, I didn\'t really.\n3\nOK, yeah, I know that much.\n3\nSo I will just put it in neutral, you know.\n2\nOK.\n3\nI would imagine.\n3\nThat most people would learn to use this.\n3\nSystem very quickly.\n3\nI\'m not sure.\n2\nI I would completely agree.\n1\nBecause it took me like 3 days.\n3\nLike so.\n3\nLike when I did the.\n3\nMy second year course right I used like I used this before any one so I kind of knew.\n3\nWhat it looks like and stuff and other people were like asking me like, oh, how can I like go in?\n3\nSo it might be just like.\n1\nRight.\n3\nLike very surface, like, very beginning.\n3\nPart I\'m not sure but.\n3\nI wouldn\'t say like most people.\n3\nYeah, so, but that also.\n1\nSo it\'s hard to like grasp it, yeah.\n3\nI guess it\'s just difficult because it just has so many functions and you know I found the system very cumbersome to use.\n1\nI see.\n3\nWhat is cumbersome.\n1\nI can I actually have to Google that as well?\n1\nSo this is larger, heavy and therefore difficult to carry or use.\n3\nAh, OK. Uh huh?\n\nA little bit.\n3\nBut it\'s just because of the nature of.\n3\nThe system OK.\n3\nI feel very confident using the system.\n3\nNo really.\n3\nWow, that\'s true.\n3\nYeah, I\'ll put it in too.\n3\nI needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.\n3\nI guess I kind of try to use it.\n3\nWell, like learning how to use it so.\n1\nSo like you.\n3\nWouldn\'t say yeah.\n3\nI needed a close of.\n3\nLike in for before starting uh.\n3\nBut then I wouldn\'t say that like my.\n3\nIt got like that high in like high like level when I\'m.\n1\nOK.\n1\nSo it\'s completely, it\'s not completely impossible, but there you have to learn along.\n3\nUsing this stuff.\n3\nThe way, yeah, I think so.\n3\nOK, good.\n3\nExplode right?\n3\nSo yeah, I guess.\n3\nYeah, like either just, like, learn along the way or what\'s those helpful resources?\n3\nOK and yeah, because.\n3\nIt\'s very specific like service and it\'s difficult like different from maybe.\n\nRight.\n3\nLike different uh.\n3\nLike thing that you you can find on the Internet like other services.\n3\nSo I guess you just need to get.\n3\nUsed to it but.\n3\nFor example, so I\'m sometimes use like universities like for this internship I use like universities collection.\n3\nAll those kind of things.\n3\nThat database is much easier for me to.\n3\nMake use and get used to, but I think it\'s just because.\n3\nIt was. It\'s like.\n3\nQuite intuitive on how to use it.\n3\nIt\'s kind of similar to maybe other things that you find right.\n3\nLike it\'s similar to like how you find images on Google and like how you find images on.\n3\nYeah, like collection like database website Bob.\n3\nThis is like specifically maps and I guess you just you just need to learn something.\n2\nOK.\n1\nDeal with it.\n1\nSo you\'re saying that it\'s counterintuitive?\n1\nIt\'s hard to grasp, it\'s.\n3\nNot I\'m saying.\n1\nBut because it\'s so special and unique, you are still willing.\n3\nTo yeah, it\'s not counterintuitive, it\'s just like.\n3\nYou need. You need to.\n3\nGet used to it.\n2\nBut I guess you want to get used to.\n3\nIt there is so much thing, so many things that you can do, I think, OK, yeah.\n3\nOK.\n3\nGot to that anymore?\n1\nThank you so much.\n1\nOne final question.\n1\nHow often do you use it?\n1\nIs it just during the assignment?\n1\nAnd the second question, what are the average session lengths?\n3\nSo far are you use it?\n3\nMostly like only for my assignment.\n3\nI think I\'ve just explored.\n3\nA few times like.\n3\nFor no pups, I just wanted to like see what kind of.\n3\nMaps they are and stuff.\n3\nSo there\'s not too much like, say.\n1\nFive around 5:00.\n1\nMaybe per semester or like the whole academic year?\n3\nPostmaster, but like for.\n3\nLike 1 project?\n3\nYeah I guess because I only had like 1 project that.\n3\nI needed to use it.\n3\nThis year, like this academic year and like this semester, and also like 1 semester in the first year.\n1\nRight.\n3\nSo it\'s like it\'s per semester, but also like.\n3\nThe first one I.\n3\nDidn\'t like yeah, either because I didn\'t have.\n1\nOK, OK, got it.\n1\nAnd how long does it take for you to?\n1\nComplete the task like.\n3\nMaybe like 10 minutes or around that.\n3\nI think for.\n1\nLike 8 session, right?\n1\nOK 10 or 15.\n1\nAnd does it differ in terms of is it for assignment or is it on your own exploring?\n\nUM.\n3\nWell, full assignment.\n2\nUM.\n3\nI I think they are like.\n3\nMostly the same for some.\n3\nI sometimes need to like do it again and again to get like the map with the thing that I want in like a center like because I sometimes like.\n1\nAlthough the printing part doesn\'t work as.\n3\nYeah, yeah.\n3\nAnd then I try to do.\n3\nAnd then.\n3\nYeah, I need to figure out like how to.\n3\nLike put them up on like a sheet of paper.\n3\nOK, then, like, download.\n3\nOK, but.\n3\nYeah, I think that\'s like the.\n1\nSession thanks.\n1\nOK.\n1\nGot it.\n1\nWell, thank you so much.\n1\nAnd that\'s exactly.\n3\nYour choice. That was health.\n1\nIt was so helpful. It\'s.\n3\nOK, it was really helpful.\n\nOK.\n3\nThank you so much.\n1\nAnd sorry to take your entire like 30 minutes, but it\'s, yeah, if you wanna end this and like, go home, we can completely just end it there.\n2\nOhh, no worries, no worries at all.\n1\nOK."'}CHAT MESSAGE: {'role': 'system', 'content': "The main points made by the speakers are:\n\n1.

Familiarization - reading and rereading transcripts, listening to audio-recordings, making notes of any initial analytic observations - helps the researcher to move the analysis beyond a focus on the most obvious meanings.\nCoding: A systematic process of identifying and labelling relevant features of the data (in relation to the research question). Coding is the first step in the process of identifying patterns in the data because it groups together similar data segments.\n\'Searching\' for themes: The \'search\' for themes is not simply one of \'discovery; the themes are not in the data waiting to be uncovered by an intrepid researcher. Rather, the researcher clusters together codes to create a plausible mapping of key patterns in the data.\nReviewing themes: The researcher pauses the process of theme generation to check whether the candidate themes exhibit a good \'fit\' with the coded data and with the entire data set, and each has a clear, distinct \'essence\' - or central organizing concept. Reviewing may lead to no or few changes, or to discarding the candidate themes and restarting the previous phase.\nDefining and naming themes: Writing theme definitions (effectively a brief summary of each there/ and selecting a theme name ensure the conceptual clarity of each theme and provide a road map for the final write-up.\nWriting the report: The researcher weaves together their analytic narrative and vivid, compeling data extracts. Themes provide the organizing framework for the analysis, but analytic concur sions are drawn across themes."\n\nPerform qualitative thematic analysis on the presented conversation. Your goal is to 1) extract codes, 2) provide a list of quotes to each code, and 3) develop themes based on the extracted codes, to answer three research questions: 1) what are the user groups of EDINA Digimap, 2) what are their primary goals of using EDINA Digimap and, 3) are the features of Digimap positively or negatively contributing to their experience of achieving those goals?'}CHAT MESSAGE: {'role': 'system', 'content': 'Based on the conversation, the thematic analysis reveals the following:\n\n1) User Groups of EDINA Digimap:\n   - Undergraduate students from the University of Edinburgh: "So you are undergraduate student."\n   - Students studying architecture, specifically architecture history and heritage: "Name the major."\n   - Students working on research projects related to architecture and building information: "All the tasks that I\'ve done are all related to like buildings."\n   \n2) Primary Goals of Using EDINA Digimap:\n   - Research purposes related to architecture: "So maybe like for like dissertation or those kind?

The primary goals of using EDINA Digimap are research purposes related to architecture, gathering information about buildings and their locations, and examining the change of sites over time using historic maps. However, the features of Digimap are perceived to have complexities and an overwhelming number of functions, a lack of clear instructions and a learning curve, and a need for more resources and support.'}
