Your aim is to summarize an interview transcript so it can then be used for qualitative thematic analysis. You must remove all irrelevant information and keep everything that could be useful for thematic analysis. \nThe interview is on the subject of user experience using the "Digimaps" software product developed by EDINA. \nInterview transcript:\n\n"2\nIf that\'s OK.\n1\nThat\'s fine.\n2\nWhat is your name of the course again?\n1\nMy like uni course.\n1\nComputational something.\n2\nWhy it\'s like so weird.\n2\nOK, compilation, physics and have you had any prior experience with other geospatial systems?\n2\nSo this is.\n2\nDigit mappings are for or have you used like other?\n1\nJust I\'ve used Google.\n1\nIf that helps.\n1\nFunny I used futures.\n2\nBecause you mentioned like Huggins, yeah.\n1\nI\'ve used QGIS a.\n1\nBit before, but not much, yeah.\n2\nLike what have you used it for?\n2\nA how long?\n2\nHave you been using that?\n1\nI guess I\'ve I\'m I\'ve used it since I started my internship. It\'s been about 2 1/2.\n\nWeeks. OK, great.\n1\nAnd that\'s been used for like visualization of point.\n1\nLike points of interest and like Council areas and such of Scotland.\n2\nSo is that like user data like internally within the system or do you like import data?\n1\nI I import those into the QGIS system cause the QGIS is basically just reading the data for me.\n1\nIt\'s not got like.\n2\nThe data in there OK, OK.\n1\nSo I basically import like different file types into and then it reads, it shows me what it.\n2\nGot OK so basically visualization.\n1\nYeah, exactly.\n2\nGot it.\n2\nAnd like, what do you what what has the major function that you\'ve been using for digit?\n1\nUh, basically, data collection using it to.\n1\nExtrapolate kind of like positions of certain things like hospitals and supermarkets and then using that in \na data index.\n2\nOK.\n2\nSo so extracting data and the data specifically is like point of interest.\n1\nAt the specifically points of interest and they\'re like coordinates and.\n2\nStuff and you\'ve been using on global.\n1\nSo no.\n1\nSo I\'ve used on ordinance, the ordinance survey way.\n\nRight.\n1\nBut I also try to use the global one, but that\'s from a lot of the data in that is from Open Street map, \nwhich is a different like.\n1\nYeah, we stole it.\n1\nNo, the steel is it\'s open source so that anyone can use it.\n1\nAnd I was like if I can get this to work, then I don\'t have to worry about.\n1\nLike light, light, light and like.\n1\nThat\'s the word I don\'t have to worry about that with my data.\n1\nBut you know, it wasn\'t as accurate.\n1\nSo I had to get around that somewhere else.\n2\nOK.\n2\nHave you done any like visualization within digimap itself?\n1\nWhat do you mean by that?\n1\nLike using the map to make a map?\n1\nYeah, no.\n2\nOK, so because we have like you can either download the data itself and.\n2\nI don\'t know or print the map out.\n2\nHave you ever used the printing?\n1\nA noise printing function because I need the actual number of numerical coordinates rather than just \nlike the visualization.\n1\nOf the map.\n2\nI see but like is there like a process before you actually download it?\n2\nOr do you like go straight in and?\n1\nI just. I just.\n1\nThis is the the Polygon selection.\n1\nSelect the arrows that I need for some problem and then download that data.\n2\nOK.\n2\nCan you show me on?\n2\nMy laptop if that\'s OK.\n1\nOh, sorry, I didn\'t realize I would have brought.\n1\nMy laptop if you want to move.\n2\nNo, no, because I have to do like a screen recording as well, so it\'s better.\n2\nOK.\n2\nAnd could you just talk me through every step you take?\n1\nWell, I clicked the ordinance.\n1\nAnd then I go to my little data download.\n2\nOh, so you were not using the?\n2\nThe like combined.\n1\nWhat one this one?\n2\nSo yeah, this one.\n1\nSo I used that initially to like scout it out and see what the datas got.\n\nOK.\n1\nInitially use this to like.\n1\nScout out like the areas and stuff and what?\n1\nWhat it contains?\n2\nRight.\n1\nBecause then like I was just double checking that it has the.\n1\nStuff that I need.\n1\nAnd then since the data download doesn\'t really show you that, I then switch to the data download.\n2\nHave you realized that there\'s stated all here as well?\n1\nWell, that\'s good to know.\n1\nWell, now I.\n1\nKnow that.\n2\nHow do you?\n2\nHow would you scout it?\n1\nClick that and then I would basically.\n1\nSo initially it\'s a bit annoying because it doesn\'t tell you like what The thing is.\n2\nWhat do you mean the thing?\n1\nSo you see how it\'s got like a symbol here.\n1\nI don\'t know what that is.\n2\nOhh, so there\'s no legend.\n1\nThere\'s no.\n1\nThis I well, I don\'t know.\n1\nTo my extents, I don\'t know those down data download but like I don\'t know if.\n1\nThere\'s a legend anywhere that could tell me what the points.\n1\nLike I know that\'s parking and.\n1\nStuff, right?\n2\nOK.\n1\nBut things like this random like bloke here look.\n\nI don\'t know what.\n1\nThat is right and like some of these symbols, I just like some of them are.\n1\nIntuitive some of them.\n1\nAnd you know, it would be good to know.\n1\nSo like if I could.\n2\nClick on it and it\'ll tell you.\n1\nAnd like click on it.\n1\nSo that\'s what we\'ve QGIS it has that kind of feature has like the point and then it has information.\n1\nOf that point to what it is and like where.\n1\nIt is and stuff like that.\n2\nOK.\n1\nWhereas this has like, it doesn\'t unless it\'s like some feature I\'m missing.\n2\nUh, I don\'t think so.\n2\nIt it?\n1\nYeah, this will work.\n2\nIt just doesn\'t.\n2\nNo, that\'s joy.\n1\nYeah, it didn\'t.\n1\nThat\'s drawing. Yeah, OK. Drawing.\n2\nSo you never use drawing tools either.\n1\nNo, because I haven\'t to draw anything.\n1\nHow do I draw?\n1\nFree hand.\n2\nSo like is it just that the work that you\'re doing doesn\'t?\n1\nRequire you to be strong, you know?\n1\nWhat I\'m doing?\n1\nWhat would you need drawing for?\n1\nWhat would it be like just showing people stuff?\n2\nYeah. Basically outlining or measuring.\n1\nMeasuring, yeah.\n1\nSee, that\'s the problem measuring, I guess it\'s.\n1\nI guess if it doesn\'t have like a particular point that you\'re measuring it from, but usually you just get the \ndata from the coordinates of that point you\'re interested.\n1\nIn and then.\n2\nOhh yeah.\n1\nGet the coordinates from the other point that you\'re interested in, and then you calculate it using the \nmachine rather than just eyeballing it I guess.\n2\nSo basically.\n2\nOK.\n1\nOK.\n1\nThat\'s why it would be useful to have something that you like click on the point and think, oh, that\'s this \ncoordinate and then you click on another point and it\'s like this is a coordinate and then it would be fun \nto have like a feature that you could have like.\n2\nWell, there, there is something that\'s called coordinate capture here you can like click and then it\'ll tell \nyou.\n1\nActually that\'s good then.\n1\nOK, that\'s good to have.\n2\nBut it\'s confusing that it\'s right here, right?\n2\nLike there\'s.\n1\nIt\'s a bit, yeah, it\'s a bit like hidden behind everything, whereas rather you could have like a feature up \nhere that like lets you just send in issues, click on a point of interest and stuff and tells you.\n2\nYeah. OK.\n2\nWhat it is OK, I see.\n2\nSo I know that used used these layers and.\n2\nHow do you think about these layers?\n2\nAre they integrated efficiently or intuitively, or do they need to be like more specific in terms of the \ncategories?\n1\nI think.\n1\nIt\'s good.\n1\nHaving the general category to filter from it cause like I know I don\'t want like transport for instance and \nI know I don\'t want sports education attractions.\n1\nAnd like accommodation, eating and drinking, however, it would be good to have sub categories where \nit would be like, for instance, health, education, health.\n2\nRight.\n2\nRight.\n1\nI for instance.\n1\nThe stuff that I would want is like the GP\'s you know, and they\'re they\'re underneath education, health, \nbut that\'s also going to come up as like schools. And I\'ve realized there\'s also comes up for, like \nhairdressers and stuff like that.\n2\nRight.\n2\nOK.\n1\nWhich means that the data has usually got a lot of noise in it.\n2\nBoy hairdressers under health.\n1\nYep, hairdressers and I didn\'t realise.\n1\nThat either for years.\n2\nOhh actually OK so.\n2\nThat would be a trade off though, because if you have like more subcategories it would be more process \nfor you to like so like through them, right?\n2\nImagine there\'s like 10 sub categories where.\n1\nAll these categories.\n1\nSo there are subcategories for all these subcategories.\n1\nThat\'s what the data has, but it doesn\'t show you in this in this.\n2\nUser interface, does it matter to you that it doesn\'t show or can you?\n2\nJust like extract it later.\n1\nYou can extract it, but then I\'d have to.\n1\nI had to use like Python scripts to get the exact like set of data that I wanted.\n2\nOK.\n2\nSo that\'s for viewing.\n2\nHow about like downloading the data have.\n2\nYou been able to select.\n1\nSo did you bet it was good in terms of like the polygons selection?\n1\nBut the only thing was you could.\n1\nWait is there is there like a was there like a way?\n1\nTo do just like Scotland.\n1\nOr do you just have to like draw the area?\n1\nThat you like.\n1\nBecause if that\'s the case, then having something that\'s like selected by country or selected by Council \narea or something would be good.\n2\nI see. I see it.\n1\nBecause otherwise I had to basically draw a Polygon that.\n1\nContained most of Scotland\'s boundaries, but then in the end I managed to somehow get in like an extra \nboundary of of England and they had to filter that out as well.\n2\nMatches exactly so. Ohh.\n2\nThat\'s a great point because I never.\n\nIf you had.\n2\nOK, yeah.\n1\nYou gotta, like, buy like country or by like council there in that country.\n1\nI mean, they\'ve been putting more data and bit more pain, but it would be.\n2\nI would imagine if you like select I don\'t know boundaries.\n2\nAnd you like draw on top of it, it would.\n2\nBe fine then so.\n1\nBut that\'s like again, it\'s like drawing a couple of boundaries, even if like slight, it\'s gonna be slightly in \nEngland, it might like, you know, download England stuff as well, which, you know, I don\'t.\n2\nI see.\n2\nGreat point actually.\n2\nThank you.\n2\nSo OK.\n2\nSo basically the functionality that you\'re using is just viewing.\n2\nSelecting overlays and downloading.\n2\nAnd what do you see as like other potential that you haven\'t been able to explore but you think there \nmight be something there?\n2\nDid you map like other than the stuff that you\'re using right now?\n1\nI\'m using.\n1\nI don\'t really know I\'ve I guess I haven\'t really used it enough to think.\n1\nAbout that.\n2\nOK.\n2\nLike, have you clicked on like every button for example?\n2\nOK.\n1\nI missed that.\n1\nYeah, I think that\'s, yeah, I couldn\'t think of anything.\n2\nOK, great.\n1\nJust don\'t use it.\n\nI am.\n2\nSo how long are your sessions last?\n2\nHow long does?\n\nYour session last.\n2\nOn average.\n1\nFor Digimon like using it like.\n1\nOther than leaving it open cause I forgot about it.\n2\nOK.\n2\nJust like actively using power.\n1\nProbably not even like.\n1\n15 minutes 15 less than that?\n2\n13 minutes.\n2\nOK.\n1\nIt probably take it probably takes longer, except I had to figure out how to.\n1\nLike download everything.\n2\nRight.\n2\nAnd including figuring out time how long?\n1\nProbably like probably like 10 to 15 minutes.\n2\nOK.\n1\nIt\'s like figuring everything out, figuring where, first of all, what data I need.\n1\nSorry, excuse me and.\n1\nWhere where it is basically because a lot of the time.\n1\nI mean you have that help button, right?\n1\nBut then I click on this and I\'m like, where the **** do I go here if I want a particular thing?\n1\nLike for instance the legend like I was.\n\nRight, right.\n1\nTrying to find the legend just like.\n2\nOh, you did look at this after, OK?\n1\nYeah, I was looking for the legend and I.\n1\nWas like.\n1\nWhere the **** do I go?\n2\nOh, you haven\'t found it, OK?\n1\nUM.\n1\nSo there\'s, like there\'s a lot here.\n2\nOK.\n1\nIn this in this help section I mean it\'s good, right?\n1\nBut again it\'s like.\n1\nFor instance, you click on this and then.\n1\nIt has even more.\n2\nRight.\n1\nLinks to it and it\'s just like.\n1\nIs the same with Admiral Unis.\n1\nLike, you know, student website.\n1\nWhere you like?\n1\nYou click on the link and it takes you to another page and you click on another link, it takes you.\n1\nAnother page and take another page.\n1\nAnother thing.\n2\nIt\'s like folded that you have to like go through so much.\n2\nNavigation to get to the.\n1\nYou have to navigate through so many different links to eventually get to catch your information you \nwant.\n1\nAnd you have.\n1\nTo kind of guess all the time.\n2\nRight and.\n1\nBut I mean, that\'s kind of hard to like improve I guess though, but you know if you\'re one of the things \nthat maybe.\n\nRight.\n1\nMaybe I don\'t know.\n1\nI\'m not an expert in UI design and stuff so.\n2\nYeah, honestly, we moved.\n2\nSo don\'t worry about it.\n2\nOK.\n2\nSo I think now I\'ll just have you to read some questions.\n2\nAnd also explain your reason for giving those scores.\n2\nWhich is good helped.\n2\nOK.\n2\nSo this is the usability system usability scale.\n2\nIt\'s nothing specific to digimap, but like overall, can you give me some?\n1\nGreat, now give this.\n1\nNow what system is it talking about?\n2\nDigit map.\n1\nWell, so not you said.\n1\nOK, never mind.\n2\nLike this scale wasn\'t designed.\n\nNever mind.\n2\nFor this.\n1\nOHS going, right.\n2\nCould you like? Yeah, yeah.\n1\nRight.\n1\nOK.\n1\nRight.\n1\nRight.\n1\nRight.\n1\nRight.\n1\nRight.\n1\nOK.\n2\nI don\'t think you can like annotate, so could you just like tell me?\n2\nI mean, yeah, if you\'d rather draw or just tell me the number.\n2\nEither way, it\'s fine.\n1\nOK, never mind that was probably.\n1\nI mean it seems pretty good.\n1\nI don\'t know how frequently I would use it.\n1\nOutside of work, but.\n1\nYeah, I\'d say 4 for that one.\n2\nOK.\n2\nAnd how frequent is that going to be?\n1\nWell, I guess it depends what.\n1\nI\'m doing.\n1\nWhat I need from it basically I guess printing out maps and all.\n1\nYeah, maybe three. I was convinced by the 4/3.\n\nOK.\n1\nYeah, maybe. Maybe like in.\n1\nThe middle, yeah.\n2\nOK.\n1\nI\'d probably use it occasionally to get stuff from it, but most of the time, but yeah.\n1\nWell, I can do more of quiche, I can.\n1\nMake my own things, OK?\n1\nI guess I didn\'t look at them making the map thing, but.\n2\nBut you will have to get the data 1st to get it.\n2\nInto Q just.\n1\nYeah, I had to get.\n1\nThe data first, so that\'s when.\n1\nI would use it.\n2\nI see.\n2\nOK, makes sense.\n1\nFound the system unnecessarily complex.\n1\nI think it was good.\n1\nI think it was fairly simple I think.\n1\nI think a lot of the time there\'s like a lot of.\n1\nThings are hidden under more.\n1\nIs is hard I guess, but I think maybe.\n2\nFour. Ohh yeah.\n1\nI think maybe 4.\n2\nIs none unnecessarily complex, or just like complex out of four.\n1\nMaybe free?\n1\nSorry, sorry.\n\nOK.\n\nOK.\n1\nSorry I\'m I\'m bad at like doing these, OK.\n1\nI thought the system was easy to use.\n1\nI think, yeah, I think it was fairly easy.\n1\nI think there were some like things that could have been like make it easier.\n1\nTo like like see what I\'m doing for instance.\n1\nLike, you know, Scotland boundaries and points of interest and stuff like that.\n1\nBecause the information is there for the points of interest like, I downloaded the points of interest and \nthey have information about them, but it\'s just not showing on the thing.\n1\nOK.\n1\nI think yeah, I think for I\'d say it\'s fairly easy to use.\n1\nOnce I got to the place that I.\n2\nOK.\n2\nBut that getting to the place part was.\n1\nI think getting to the place was like the one that struggled a little bit.\n1\nI think we would need the support of tenant though.\n2\nLike a 12, OK.\n1\nI did have to ask James a little bit, but I was like just because I was very new to like myself.\n\nRight. OK.\n2\nWhat question were they?\n1\nIt was the flu.\n1\nWhere do I go to download the data and he\'s?\n1\nLike yeah, just there, ohh, he told.\n2\nYou to go to a separate?\n2\nYeah, he\'s told.\n1\nYou OK?\n1\nThat\'s what.\n1\nSo he obviously doesn\'t know either.\n1\nI found the various functions in the system very well integrated.\n1\nWhat like they weren\'t buggy or anything.\n2\nI mean, just like, yeah, probably.\n2\nOr like they lay out the the the IT was it intuitive for you.\n1\nI think again though, it was like getting to the maybe some of the layout was a little less.\n1\nIntuitive and maybe.\n2\nSo like coordinate capture for example.\n1\nYeah, stuff like that.\n1\nI think maybe three.\n1\nOK, and for that.\n1\nThought there was too much?\n1\nNah, that was good.\n1\nStrongly disagree.\n1\nIt was all very consistent, very vain and you know.\n1\nI did have things I needed would learn to use this very quickly.\n1\nYeah, I\'d say, I\'d say I\'d say 4.\n1\nYou could probably sit down and learn it pretty easily.\n1\nAnd something comes into you.\n2\nProbably like a three.\n2\nOhh really that\'s like a.\n1\nIt\'s like in the middle because it it was like in the middle, there\'s like kind of.\n2\nKind of bad.\n2\nRight.\n2\nOK.\n2\nI get your point.\n1\nHow many are on either side, 1212?\n2\nBut like.\n2\nSo so this is like not cumbersome.\n1\nThis is like this is like.\n1\nIs comes but also not.\n1\nIt\'s kind of in the middle.\n1\nIt\'s like it\'s like it\'s.\n2\nOK.\n2\nOK.\n2\nWhat part of it do you think is cumbersome besides the area?\n1\nI think you know like the the.\n1\nArea well, like the Polygon drawing the area and like you know the the stuff that I\'ve talked about the \nentire time.\n1\nBecause I have.\n1\nNothing else to.\n1\nTalk about having used it that much.\n2\nMakes sense?\n1\nUM.\n1\nYeah, I think it\'s it\'s good.\n1\nOtherwise they\'re just those points would be like like pulling it down.\n1\nA bit felt very confident using the system, yeah.\n1\nI felt confident, but I felt like I.\n1\nWasn\'t like, really.\n1\nConfused and didn\'t feel outdated or anything so.\n1\nI\'d say 4.\n1\nI need to learn a lot of things before I could get going.\n1\nNo, that\'s a that\'s a 2.\n2\nOK, So what things are you thinking?\n2\nWhen you\'re.\n1\nWhat I need to?\n1\nLearn or just like where everything.\n2\nIs ohh so within the system.\n2\nI mean like the actual like other kind of information for example like geographic information and like, \nyeah, those kind of.\n1\nI guess like learning the definitions of like points of interest and stuff like that.\n1\nSo like.\n1\nYou\'d think maybe.\n1\nMedical buildings would be in under buildings definition rather than like points of interest, which is like \nwouldn\'t a point of interest be like a statue or something?\n\nRight.\n2\nOh, like a statue.\n1\nYeah, like, well, like, a tourist thing.\n1\nOr like a.\n2\nOhh point of like interest tourists.\n1\nPoint of interest, yeah, but like, but like instead of because you don\'t think hospitals a point of interest, \ndo you really think that\'s very interesting?\n2\nI feel like that\'s just like terminology in yeah.\n1\nYeah, I know, but that\'s what I was saying.\n1\nThat\'s the terminology you like.\n1\nView of stuff, you know, terminology.\n1\nThat\'s a big part of things like.\n1\nThat but you know.\n2\nOh yeah, too.\n2\nOK, got it.\n2\nAnd one final question, what kind of like data type?\n2\nDo you use?\n2\nWhen you were done.\n1\nI think it was shape files, though I think it was like Geo package.\n2\nOK.\n1\nI think.\n1\nYeah, I\'m going with Geo.\n1\nPackage. That\'s my final answer.\n2\nOK, got it.\n2\nWell, thank you for.\n\nNo problem.\n2\nTaking part in my interview.\n"\n\nBegin!'}CHAT MESSAGE: {'role': 'system', 'content': 'The interview transcript is focused on the user\'s experience with the "Digimaps" software product developed by EDINA.
