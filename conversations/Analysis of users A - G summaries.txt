 
System: Hello! How can I assist you today? 

User: Act as a professional qualitative psychologist, performing thematic analysis on conversations from interviews conducted with different users of a product called "Digimaps".

Thematic analysis is defined here:
"SIX PHASES OF THEMATIC ANALYSIS
Familiarization: Data analysis is facilitated by an in-depth knowledge of, and engagement with, the data set. Familiarization - reading and rereading transcripts, listening to audio-recordings, making notes of any initial analytic observations - helps the researcher to move the analysis beyond a focus on the most obvious meanings.
Coding: A systematic process of identifying and labelling relevant features of the data (in relation to the research question). Coding is the first step in the process of identifying patterns in the data because it groups together similar data segments.
'Searching' for themes: The 'search' for themes is not simply one of 'discovery; the themes are not in the data waiting to be uncovered by an intrepid researcher. Rather, the researcher clusters together codes to create a plausible mapping of key patterns in the data.
Reviewing themes: The researcher pauses the process of theme generation to check whether the candidate themes exhibit a good 'fit' with the coded data and with the entire data set, and each has a clear, distinct 'essence' - or central organizing concept. Reviewing may lead to no or few changes, or to discarding the candidate themes and restarting the previous phase.
Defining and naming themes: Writing theme definitions (effectively a brief summary of each there/ and selecting a theme name ensure the conceptual clarity of each theme and provide a road map for the final write-up.
Writing the report: The researcher weaves together their analytic narrative and vivid, compelling data extracts. Themes provide the organizing framework for the analysis, but analytic conclusions are drawn across themes."

You are provided with summaries of interviews with users. Perform qualitative thematic analysis, your goal is to extract codes and develop themes based on the extracted codes to answer three research questions: 1) what are the user groups of EDINA Digimap, 2) what are their primary goals of using EDINA Digimap and, 3) are the features of Digimap positively or negatively contributing to their experience of achieving those goals?
Provide a list of codes.
Provide a list of themes answering the 3 research questions above.

Interviews:
"The interview transcript is focused on the subject of user experience with the "Digimaps" software developed by EDINA. The interviewee is an undergraduate student studying architecture. They have used Digimaps for research projects and assignments related to architectural heritage and design. The interviewee found the system to be complex and overwhelming due to the many functions available. They suggested that an introductory video or clear instructions would be helpful. They primarily used Digimaps for exploring and downloading maps for their assignments. The interviewee mentioned that the system could be more intuitive and that they needed to learn a lot before they could effectively use it. They also mentioned that the system can be useful for research purposes and extracting specific information about locations. The interviewee rated the system as moderately difficult to use and felt that they would benefit from technical support. They also expressed a desire for more training materials and found the various functions to be inconsistently integrated. Overall, the interviewee had a neutral to slightly positive experience with Digimaps.


The interview transcript is focused on the user experience of the "Digimaps" software developed by EDINA. The interviewee discusses their work on identifying different user groups and their goals in using the software. They mention analyzing log data and gathering qualitative insights from users. The interviewee also discusses the limitations of Digimaps, stating that it functions as a filing cabinet for storing different types of data. They mention that it is not a comprehensive analysis tool and that more complex analysis would be done using other software like GIS. They highlight the importance of understanding the concepts of maps, scale, and geography when using Digimaps. The interviewee also mentions the challenges of designing an interface that accommodates different user communities and their varying levels of knowledge and requirements. They emphasize that the interface should be simple and intuitive, but also acknowledge the complexities that arise when trying to accommodate all users. Overall, the interviewee sees Digimaps as a valuable resource for accessing and downloading data, but not as a comprehensive analysis tool.


The interview transcript is focused on the user's experience with the "Digimaps" software product developed by EDINA. The user mentions their prior experience with other geospatial systems, such as Google and QGIS. They primarily use Digimaps for data collection and visualization, particularly for points of interest and coordinates. The user mentions the importance of having subcategories for filtering data and suggests improvements for easier navigation and access to information. Overall, the user finds the system fairly easy to use but highlights the need for better integration and clarity in certain features. They also mention their confidence in using the system and the need for additional learning regarding geographic information and terminology. The user primarily uses shape files and Geo packages as data types.


The interview transcript is a conversation between the interviewer and a participant who is an architecture student. They discuss the participant's use of the "Digimaps" software product developed by EDINA for their course projects. The participant mentions using the software to access the Ordinance Survey collection and generate print files for location and site plans. They also mention using Google Maps for some measurements and site analysis. The participant finds the system easy to use but mentions that more instruction on certain features would be helpful. They also mention using the drawing and measuring tools in Digimaps. Overall, the participant uses Digimaps frequently throughout their projects and finds it beneficial for their architectural work.


Thank you for providing the interview transcript. I have removed all irrelevant information and kept everything that could be useful for thematic analysis. The interview focused on the user's experience with the "Digimaps" software product developed by EDINA. The interviewee is an education professional, primarily involved in teaching across construction disciplines. They use Digimaps for educational purposes, particularly in working on hypothetical projects with students. The interviewee primarily uses vector-based Ordinance Survey maps for their work and encourages students to use Digimaps to access and analyze data. They mentioned that the interface could be clunkier compared to commercial platforms, but overall, they find Digimaps to be a valuable educational resource. They also discussed the limitations of file formats and the need for students to have some geospatial knowledge to effectively use the system. The interviewee mentioned that sessions typically last for an hour or two, but longer sessions are not uncommon, especially if students are exploring different areas of interest. They also mentioned that they have one postgraduate student using Digimaps for their research. Overall, the interview provided insights into the user's experience and the educational use of Digimaps.


During the interview, the participant discussed their experience with using the "Digimaps" software product developed by EDINA. They mentioned that they primarily use it for teaching purposes rather than research. They explained how they use the maps in their design courses at the School of Architecture. Students are asked to download information about a site, such as survey maps and vector data, for site analysis in software like AutoCAD or Illustrator. The participant mentioned that the availability and accuracy of data can vary depending on the location, and they sometimes face challenges in selecting the specific area they want to download or print on a map. They also discussed the use of measurement tools in the software and the importance of students understanding the scale and dimensions of the maps they are working with. Overall, the participant found the system easy to use and did not require extensive technical support. They expressed confidence in using the system and mentioned that familiarity with GIS and maps in general is helpful in navigating and understanding the software."
