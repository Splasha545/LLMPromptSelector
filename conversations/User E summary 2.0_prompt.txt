Your aim is to summarize an interview transcript so it can then be used for qualitative thematic analysis. You must remove all irrelevant information and keep everything that could be useful for thematic analysis. \nThe interview is on the subject of user experience using the "Digimaps" software product developed by EDINA. \nInterview transcript:\n"1\nSo first of all, may I just ask what is the name of your institution and department through which you\'re \naccessing the map?\n2\nThe architecture department.\n2\nSo yeah, not sure what\'s your name but.\n1\nRight.\n1\nAnd could you just tell me the name of the university as well, please?\n2\nThe University of Strathclyde.\n1\nOK, OK, great.\n1\nGood to know so and what course specifically are you taking at that institution?\n2\nJust architecture.\n1\nOK, so the the name is called architecture.\n2\nYeah, I think it\'s just architecture anyway.\n2\nI think that\'s sorry, my cameras seems to be having issues.\n2\nIt keeps saying your cameras not working.\n3\nOhh no, it\'s alright.\n1\nDon\'t don\'t worry about the camera.\n1\nOK?\n1\nSo is it a four year program or like what year are you currently?\n2\nIt\'s seven, it\'s 7.\n2\nYears in total, but it\'s sort of like in fourth year you can go to work for a year, so.\n2\nJust like I think you graduate.\n2\nMaybe after four and then you go on and do your next part.\n1\nOhh wow, that\'s I didn\'t know it was such a degree from 7 years.\n1\nSo can you do it separately or do you have to finish the entire thing?\n1\nTo get like a degree.\n2\nNo, I think you can finish after the first part, but it\'s not like the complete degree.\n2\nSo it\'s like I think if you want to become an actual architect, you have to.\n2\nDo the whole.\n2\nSeven years, I see.\n1\nAnd so you\'re currently in?\n2\nI\'ve just finished second year OK to go into third.\n2\nYear next year. OK, great.\n1\nYeah. So have you had?\n1\nAny prior experience with any geographic information system before you enter?\n1\nIn this program.\n2\nThe first I\'d say I hadn\'t looked at digimap for anything before doing architecture, but it\'s quite a like a \nlot of people use it in our course.\n2\nSo that\'s their first.\n2\nFirst heard about.\n1\nI see.\n1\nSo the four digit map.\n1\nHave you ever used like similar products or like Google Maps?\n1\nDo you use like maps system usually?\n2\nI would use.\n2\nUsually before just Google Maps all the time, still use Google Maps obviously, but just for architecture I \nalways use digimap.\n1\nOK, I see.\n1\nThank you.\n1\nSo for my understanding.\n1\nSo you\'ve been using it for almost 2 years now we so since.\n1\nYou OK? Great.\n1\nAnd what collections do you most frequently use?\n2\nSo I always use the same sort of thing.\n2\nI don\'t use a few of them, it\'s normally just the ordinance survey part of the G map that we used and \noccasion.\n2\nI\'ve looked at the.\n2\nHistoric one before just for like some parts.\n2\nSo I\'ve not looked.\n2\nI was having a look on it this morning again to see the other ones.\n2\nThey do. I\'ve not really.\n2\nHad a look at the other.\n2\nSort of environment area like the those sort of ones have not.\n2\nIt\'s normally the ordinance survey.\n1\nOK, I see.\n2\nThat I use.\n1\nYeah, yeah, I\'ve been hearing that from a lot of people as well because.\n1\nAnd you know, we\'ve like integrated.\n1\nSo there used to be two parts of the Ordnance Survey, so there\'s like a room part where you can, like, \nbrowse the data and just like, look around on the map.\n1\nApps and there\'s another part called download.\n1\nSo basically you just go straight in to download data and now we have like an integration of these two \nsystems.\n1\nAnd what part of it do you?\n1\nMostly use, you would say.\n2\nNormally go into it and then so far architecture.\n2\nWe get given like a area that are like projects based in.\n2\nSo for example my last project was based in Saint Andrews and it\'s like you get a site to work on uh, so I \nuse it sort of for different scales.\n2\nSo we maybe get asked to do like location plans and site plans and we all get asked to do.\n2\nSpecific scale. So maybe like 1 to 125 or 1 to 500, so I\'ll sort of go in and.\n2\nAnd the area that we\'re being asked to like build on and then I would download it at a certain scale.\n2\nSo then I can like sort of use that to do like initial planning of like sketches and ideas and and like just.\n2\nSo you\'ve got the area in front of you and you can see the.\n2\nContext around around what you\'re doing.\n2\nSo yeah, it\'s mostly just for the initial like.\n2\nSort of site site planning and stuff and.\n2\nLike context of the area that we\'re doing our projects on.\n2\nIf that makes any sense.\n1\nYeah, that makes total sense.\n1\nAnd I just wanted to add some follow up questions.\n1\nSo first of all, you mentioned that this is for a course project and is it based on the teaching setting or so \nlike, is it an assignment for a specific course or is it like an independent research project?\n2\nAnd so of course we have in architecture, we\'ve got design studios and in design studios we get given \nlike we all get given a project.\n2\nSo for example, I\'ll just give you an example of a random one, but we have like a library project, so we \nget asked all the year that\'s doing our architecture at Strathclyde.\n2\nBut yeah, it gets asked to do this like library project and you get given maybe like a area.\n2\nSo for example as in Saint Andrews and you get a list of.\n2\nRequirements that you have to cover by the end of the project.\n2\nSo it\'s like we\'re all doing it, but our own sort of individual project, but we\'re all doing.\n2\nSo we\'re all designing our own one, obviously, but in the same area.\n1\nI see.\n2\nSo yeah, so we use it quite often.\n2\nIt\'ll in the list of requirements we get, it will quite often say like.\n2\nProduce allocation plan at scale one to 125 or a site plan at 1 to 500. So that\'s where I mostly use \ndigimap for to help.\n1\nI see. I see.\n1\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense.\n1\nAnd I\'ve heard that there are some like set of rules, for example like the scale you use and which you\'ll \nsee there\'s a lot more instruction when you started to use the gmap.\n1\nSo basically was there like a walkthrough of like how you should navigate through the system where you \ncan find?\n1\nLike all the functions and features, et cetera.\n2\nI can\'t remember because it was a while ago that we got told that we must have been told about it quite \nearly on, but I don\'t remember there being like a huge thing of like how to work.\n2\nI think I remember just sort of.\n2\nTrying to navigate it myself or like my friend helping me holiday do it for example, but I don\'t.\n2\nI don\'t think from my understanding group but.\n2\nThere was like a class.\n2\nOr anything on how to use it?\n1\nI see.\n1\nAnd so like during the project itself.\n1\nSo you mentioned the scale and can you give me some other like specific instructions like is it something \nlike go on to digit map, open the owner service collection like go to the specific base?\n1\nApp and like select the area.\n1\nIs it something like this or is it?\n1\nLike more simple, just the.\n2\nIt\'s more just I can see at some point if I can get up for you, but.\n2\nIt\'s like we\'ll have a.\n2\nWe have at just a design brief and then it will say at the end of it a list of like requirements.\n2\nIt doesn\'t tell you like how what to use for or whatever, but a lot of people know.\n2\nI think in the course to use just to use for it because it\'s good, easy and.\n2\nLike to find what you need.\n1\nI see. So you have.\n1\nTo figure out it yourself.\n2\nYeah, it doesn\'t specifically say like use digimap to do this, it it\'s sort of just, I think, yeah, quite a lot of \npeople know of digimap, so they know to use it.\n1\nI see.\n1\nOK, great.\n1\nAnd also you mentioned that you download the map for like later plans.\n1\nSo is it so we have like different sections of download, so you can either print the map out which is just \nlike a map?\n1\nThank you.\n1\nDownload as a PDF or whatever, and there\'s the second part where you download the specific data that \nyou select.\n1\nSo which download are you mainly using it for?\n2\nSo I haven\'t looked him up now and see what I would do, so I would go on and then I think I go up to the \nprint generator file for printing and then I would.\n1\nRight.\n2\nChange the scale to whichever scale I need for the task and then I would keep it in the PDF and then \nnormally print out like a three or whatever, but it I normally would print out.\n1\nOK.\n1\nOK, I see.\n1\nAnd have you ever downloaded it?\n1\nDoes your car like, does any of the course require the raw data?\n1\nFor your designs.\n2\nNormally, no.\n2\nNormally I use digimap as sort of a tool to like I would get the base printed off and then from then I \nwould then trace over it or draw over it like I wouldn\'t hand in work.\n2\nThat was like just off the jump.\n2\nI\'d sort of.\n2\nI\'d use digimap as the tool to then generate my own work sort of thing.\n1\nOK.\n1\nI see.\n1\nOK.\n1\nGot it.\n1\nSo sorry, I\'m just looking at the set of questions side and.\n1\nSo are you comfortable with sharing your screen or do you want me to open it up on my side OK.\n2\nYeah, I\'ve not.\n2\nI\'ve not used before, but I\'ll try.\n2\nI would say my camera doesn\'t seem to be working though, so I\'m not sure if it will.\n2\nWork just be.\n1\nIf you look at the top right corner beside the red button called leave, there\'s like a share button.\n2\nAnd then is it just?\n1\nShare a screen?\n1\nOr window.\n1\nIf you select a specific window, but either.\n1\nWay is fine.\n2\nEntire screen see if this breaks one SEC.\n2\nI\'m not sure why it\'s not letting.\n2\nAnd click.\n2\nIt\'s going to try and share this whole screen, but I\'m not sure if it\'s.\n2\nGoing to let me.\n2\nI can try and do, uh, just share it.\n2\nTab, see if that work.\n2\nDo you want me to go digimap is that?\n1\nYes, please.\n\nOK.\n1\nCan you see that?\n1\nPerfect.\n1\nSo I\'ll go back.\n2\nSo yeah, you just want me to show you what the avid is.\n1\nYes, please.\n1\nAnd could you just like talk me through every step?\n1\nSo like for every button that you click on, could you like explain why you\'re going there?\n2\nYeah. So.\n2\nI I I\'ll just do what I usually do cause I don\'t really know much, but I always go on to the ordinance \nsurvey, part of it, and then I would go here to the OS digimap on that.\n2\nAnd and then for example, I would go to the search to wherever my projects based and I\'d maybe so for \nexample, Saint Andrews.\n1\nRight.\n\nRight.\n2\nI just go to there and then I would come to the screen and then I would zoom in to wherever my my \nproject, my project spaced.\n2\nSo for example.\n2\nI don\'t know.\n2\nWe might be.\n2\nWorking on a project.\n2\nThat\'s like.\n2\nDown here, this is just this isn\'t exactly where our mine was, but it\'s just an example, right?\n2\nBut see, see, we got sorry, say we got asked to do a building in this green space, right?\n2\nQuite good.\n2\nBecause I would then go to.\n2\nGenerate print file.\n2\nI could maybe say if I was doing a location plan, I would get at that scale.\n2\nAnd go to layout preview just to sort of get exactly where I want it to go.\n2\nGenerate the print file.\n2\nAnd then it clicked on here.\n2\nAnd then I would print that out.\n2\nAnd I would sort of use that to sort of get the sizing of what I want.\n2\nIn here and sort of use the context around it as like help.\n2\nBut that\'s mainly what I would use it for and obviously doing it at different scales so I could do it at.\n2\nThat one and then.\n2\nI could do a closer up sort of scale so I could get more detail once I get into more final plans and stuff.\n2\nYeah, but can you still see my screen?\n1\nYes, I can.\n2\nCan you see it when I like flick into different ones?\n1\nUh, no, sorry.\n1\nI can only see digit map because probably you just hit the tab but but that\'s completely fine.\n1\nI yeah, I understand your steps now, so I just had like a few questions on your step.\n\nOK.\n1\nSo have you ever noticed, like other tools besides just like download for example, you can select base \nmaps and because I noticed that you zoomed into the vector map and have you ever choose like the \noverlays of the map to adjust for what areas or what part of the maps that you want?\n1\nIt to print.\n2\nAnd so I forgot to mention, I\'d also sometimes use.\n2\nSo when I go to print it, I\'ve used like I\'ve added on for example like National Grid lines.\n2\nOh, right. I\'ve done that before. Just for we went. We once got asked to do a site section model, so sort \nof like a 3D like actual model of the land to show like the gradient and stuff. So I\'ve used the grid lines \nbefore to like create a A model.\n2\nOf what it would be like in real life, but not really explored.\n2\nThe other things that you mentioned.\n1\nI see.\n1\nAnd so there was no requirement on these selections either.\n2\nWhat was it? Sorry.\n1\nThere is no requirement from the course for you to use.\n1\nThese features, right?\n2\nThey didn\'t really show us how to use it, but they probably expect us to try and learn.\n1\nYeah, I know, because it\'s such a complicated system because I started from knowing nothing about the \nmath either, and it took me days just to like, sit in front of the screen and figure out what everything \nwas.\n1\nYeah, yeah.\n2\nA lot of it\'s just sort of with like.\n2\nAnd you\'re like peers and stuff, just all sort of showing each other how that everyone does it.\n2\nAnd that\'s sort of how we want to learn that, yeah.\n1\nHave you ever used the drawing and measuring tools on here?\n1\nBecause I would imagine you have to do some type of movement and drawing.\n1\nBut do you usually do that after you print the map out, or do you have?\n\nI think.\n2\nAnd I think I have used the tools I.\n2\nOhh I have also used the.\n2\nQuite often when I\'m looking at like the site, so I use that as like.\n2\nFor all the buildings around it in context, but quite often when I\'m measuring the area of the site, I\'ve \nused Google.\n2\nIt\'s like Google Earth sort of thing and whereas because I don\'t think I really knew about Digimap being \nable to do that.\n2\nSo I,\n2\nOften use like Google or there is something to get the site areas and dimensions.\n1\nRight.\n1\nAnd I\'m sorry, could you just get the screen back up if possible, because I wanted to show you how you \ncan do that on the map.\n2\nMy computer.\n1\nYeah, sorry or I can share my screen if you do.\n2\nOh no, I can.\n2\nI can share.\n2\nIt\'s so was it.\n2\nThe did you map again?\n1\nYes, please.\n2\nDid you see?\n2\nYeah, one second.\n2\nI\'ll see if I can.\n1\nSorry for the frustration.\n2\nOK. Is can you see?\n1\nThat so if you look at the bar on the left and it says drawing tools and if you click click on that.\n1\nYeah, and.\n1\nCould you just try to based on the look of it and trying to see if you if it\'s intuitive for you to use?\n2\nOh, so you can actually draw on it and.\n1\nYes, yes you could.\n2\nStuff as well.\n2\nI didn\'t realize that actually.\n2\nI\'ll take it away.\n1\nRight.\n1\nAnd you can also measure.\n3\nIt is really confusing.\n2\nIntro land there we.\n2\nGo and.\n2\nOK.\n2\nAnd so it\'s, you know, it\'s it\'s quite it\'s weird you know on.\n1\nYeah, if you if you double click on a point, it will stop drawing.\n2\nOhh, double click.\n2\nOh yeah.\n2\nClick and select to move the chair.\n2\nOh, I didn\'t realise you get different.\n2\nLike you can have like lion.\n2\nThat\'s quite cool.\n1\nYeah, there are so that you can make your map more specific in terms of what you want to see when \nyou print.\n1\nIt out.\n2\nI was there.\n1\nYou have to click on the thing.\n1\nThat you drew to measure.\n1\nOK. Yeah.\n2\nOh, OK, cool.\n1\nYeah. So is it.\n1\nSomething that will use like similar to what you use Google, I mean.\n1\nGoogle Maps for.\n2\nYeah, I didn\'t realize you could do all of this.\n2\nI\'ll definitely have a look.\n2\nI\'m not very good with computers to start with, that\'s.\n3\nNo, it\'s our system is so confusing cause it\'s been around for like more than 20 years and it\'s so like \nancient in terms of.\n3\nThe interface, yeah.\n2\nNot realize something.\n2\nI\'ll go.\n1\nAnd so if you could also cause we have like a a FAQ page.\n1\nHave you ever noticed where it was and have you ever tried to find it?\n2\nI haven\'t, haven\'t actually.\n1\nSo within the map, if you click on the OS system again, so go back to the map if you could please.\n1\nAnd there\'s on the top bar, you can see a question mark.\n1\nYeah, and that would be the help page and.\n1\nIs there anything that you would normally need in terms of getting?\n1\nFamiliar with the system?\n1\nAt the beginning, do you think it\'s helpful on the?\n2\nNo, I I think that looks helpful.\n2\nI definitely will have a look at.\n2\nCan you still?\n2\nSee my screen.\n1\nNot really, but that\'s alright.\n2\nI\'m switching between.\n3\nNo, it\'s completely alright, yeah.\n2\nBut I\'m having a look at it here right now that does look helpful.\n2\nI definitely will have a look at the.\n2\nLike laying tools and the measure tools on here because I didn\'t realize that you could do that.\n1\nAnd also if you go to the.\n1\nBecause there are also learning materials and if you go to the learning materials it has like specific task \nscenarios where you can practice on, yeah.\n2\nThere\'s a lot of stuff in here.\n1\nYeah, there actually is and so.\n1\nHas anyone noticed it before?\n1\nAs you know of like your classmates and nobody mentioned to you that there was a help page.\n2\nNo, I I think most of us just know do sort of like the base text of like what I showed you earlier.\n2\nBut I I don\'t know many people that like actually use the measure tool and stuff.\n2\nFor example on it it\'s mostly just, yeah.\n1\nI see.\n1\nI see.\n1\nAnd so I think that.\n1\nNow understand what your typical tasks are and UM, can I just ask, like, from your perception, what are \nthe main functions of digimap and out of the function that you\'re perceiving that there are, what major \nfunctions are you using currently?\n2\nWait, so is it?\n2\nSorry, but what?\n1\nSo by the look of it, what do you think this system is trying to do and out of all the functions that it could \npossibly achieve, what functions are you mostly using?\n2\nWell I am.\n2\nI feel like there\'s a lot of functions of the digimap that I\'ve I\'ve not explored yet, but a lot of probably \nother people in different courses, but I\'m sure use the ones that that I\'ve not looked at yet, but yeah, \nmainly.\n2\nMain mainly in architecture is just the OS one that I\'ve used just for like context around.\n2\nI can try and share my screen on like what I\'m trying to explain about like.\n2\nSee if this works.\n2\nLet me know if you can.\n2\nYou can see it so.\n1\nRight now is your face.\n2\nCan you still see me?\n1\nYeah, but it\'s like kind of frozen.\n2\nOhh yeah, it\'s a black.\n2\nIt\'s just a black screen for me so.\n2\nSure. Can you see my?\n1\nScreen yes I can.\n2\nSo like for example, this is just a.\n2\nThis is a cut down version of my project, but for example.\n2\nThis like location and site plans if you can.\n2\nSee that?\n2\nYes, trying to pretend to slideshow like I use digimap to sort of create that location plan at that scale.\n2\nI used the generate print field to sort of get the sizing of that just to show the location of like where my \nproject would be and then.\n2\nThe site plan to then put my one of my plans into it just to see how it would fit at that scale.\n2\nIf I\'m not sure, is it clear?\n1\nYeah, it it is.\n1\nI just noticed that like the colors and the map content are slightly different from.\n2\nYeah, I did that myself.\n2\nLike I I went, I brought that into a different program to then, like change drop over it.\n2\nTo change the colors.\n2\nSo it fit in with my project and then I let\'s see if I\'ve got any more.\n2\nI sort of use.\n2\nDid you map here again?\n2\nFor example in the to to just see how my building would like fit in with the and and like here again in my \nfinal proposals I used DIGIMAP to to.\n2\nAnd show like the roads and the buildings like around it to then put my plans over.\n1\nI see so.\n2\nIn fact.\n1\nBasically for like site information on like the surroundings.\n\nOf the buildings.\n1\nYeah. OK.\n1\nOK.\n1\nI see that was really clear.\n1\nThank you so much.\n2\nThat\'s OK.\n1\nOK, so so now I think just like a.\n1\nI\'ll start to share my screen if that is OK cause.\n1\nThere is like a system usability scale that there are 10 questions.\n1\nCan you see by these questions clearly?\n1\nOK.\n1\nIt would be great if you could so this questionnaire wasn\'t specifically designed for digit map, but could \nyou like think of digit map when you\'re giving a rating to this?\n1\nQuestions and explain your reason of your score please.\n1\nThank you.\n\nOK.\n2\nAnd I\'ll start with that.\n2\nI think I would.\n2\nLike to.\n2\nYeah, I would say 5 probably for for the first one.\n1\nOK.\n2\nAnd probably because, yeah, I think throughout the projects like it will always have have location that \nit\'s like obviously set in.\n2\nSo I\'ll never not really need to need a program like that, because for whichever wherever the projects \nbased.\n2\nIt\'s handy to have the program for like changing the skills and sort of being able to draw over and and \nuse it.\n2\nSo yeah, I\'d probably say 5 for the first one, second one.\n2\nI found the system unnecessary and complex.\n2\nSo I would.\n2\nI\'d say or I\'d maybe say 2.\n1\nOK.\n2\nWait, no, wait.\n2\nSo I would I say.\n2\nI think I think it\'s quite laid out well.\n2\nI wouldn\'t say it\'s hard to.\n2\nGet around.\n2\nI just think I need to put more time into.\n1\nRight. Yeah and.\n2\nI see.\n2\nSo yeah, I disagree with that.\n2\nI thought the system was easy to use.\n2\nYeah, I\'d say probably 4/4 for that because I it probably should be 5. I\'d say it is, it is easy to use and \nvarious or maybe 5.\n2\nOK, so I do think it\'s easy to use and there\'s a help page and everything.\n2\nIs that?\n2\nI just think I need to sort of.\n2\nLook into that.\n1\nRight, right.\n1\nLike the confusing part is that like, the there was no instruction from the beginning for.\n1\nYou to have a thorough guy.\n2\nSo I don\'t see that that.\n2\nSo I just say maybe within the course we should maybe be taught how to.\n2\nUse it, but that\'s.\n1\nI see.\n2\nAnd and then four, I think that I would.\n2\nNeed just more of a technical person to use it.\n2\nNo, I probably disagree.\n2\nI\'d maybe go too on that one.\n2\nAgain, I think it would maybe be helpful to have someone to explain how to use it, but I do think it is, it \nshould be easy enough to work out yourself like it\'s it is laid out well.\n2\nI\'ve I think I\'ve found the assumption system alright.\n2\nYeah, I\'d I\'d say 5 again.\n2\nI think I agree.\n1\nAgree with that was the intuitive to you like where the features were based at and.\n2\nYeah, I think.\n2\nI think there\'s a lot of functions on on it as well that you told me about today, that which are definitely \nsorry two years.\n2\nOK, 6.\n2\nNo, I could you explain that one?\n2\nA bit, Lauren. What?\n1\nYeah, six.\n1\nSo basically you know that although you haven\'t used this much, so there\'s like a data download and \nthere\'s a map print function and then some like some people will find it confusing because they\'re based \nin two different areas and.\n1\nAnd data download could be mistaken for map printing and.\n1\nSo that was.\n1\nAn example from inconsistency of like the word choice.\n1\nAnd like the functions, so like it\'s both for exporting the information but one is located on the sidebar \nand one is at the top bar.\n1\nSo that was.\n1\nExample of inconsistency.\n2\nI\'ll maybe go in the middle.\n2\nWith that one because.\n2\nI\'m not too sure, OK.\n1\nYeah, that\'s reasonable.\n2\nFor me, for me, it\'s always been fine.\n2\nLike I\'ve always just used the same ones.\n2\nI think that\'s why it\'s always been fine for me.\n1\nOK.\n2\nI\'d imagine that most people would learn to use your system quickly.\n2\nYeah, I I\'d say 5 for that.\n2\nOK, I think a lot of people like micros have managed to learn to use it.\n2\nQuite quick.\n2\nI found the most very cumbersome 2 years.\n2\nWhat does compress done?\n1\nIt\'s like there\'s a lot of drag in using the system.\n1\nYou have to do like so, so much unnecessary things to get to.\n1\nThe purpose of it?\n2\nNo, I\'d say I\'d say one I.\n1\nOK.\n1\nOK, that\'s great to hear.\n2\nI I felt very confident using this system.\n2\nI\'ll, I\'ll go.\n2\nThree or four, but I\'d say three before, but four.\n2\nI\'ll say it better now, after you explained.\n2\nExplain that more, but I would maybe say before starting with three just because I I there\'s a lot.\n2\nI still think I don\'t don\'t need to like learn about like.\n2\nThat you\'ve made it clearer.\n1\nThank you for taking time.\n2\nI needed to learn a lot of things.\n2\nBefore I could get.\n1\nGoing so here, the things would be specifically knowledge about geographic information systems like \ngeospatial data etc.\n2\nAnd no, I probably say 2-2 maybe disagree. I don\'t think so, but.\n1\nOK.\n1\nOK.\n1\nThat\'s great.\n1\nWell, thank you so much for answering those questions and that was pretty much everything that I \nwanted to ask and I will just stop, stop sharing my screen and.\n1\nI think those final question that I missed from the beginning and that would be our final question for \ntoday.\n1\nSo you mentioned that you would probably use it for a course project and could you tell me like the \nfrequency in a semester and like how long are your sessions usually?\n2\nAnd so.\n2\nI\'d say.\n2\nYou\'d use it quite a lot throughout the whole project, so we we normally get like.\n2\nWithin like for example, last year, we sort of had a project, so per semester.\n2\nSo it\'s like a long project.\n2\nSo we\'ll be doing this project for maybe like 10 to 12 weeks throughout the project.\n2\nI\'d say you use it quite a lot towards the start of the project just to get like the initial like.\n2\nSites, dimensions and spaces, but then you probably also use it.\n2\nFor a bit of site analysis, and also, you\'d probably use it all the way throughout the project because \nyou\'re always constantly say we\'re making like doing floor plans and stuff.\n2\nThey\'re like all of the time you\'re showing your tutors your new plans, they like to see it in context.\n2\nSo they\'ll always ask you to sort of hit your plan onto like a map, for example.\n2\nLike, did you map to show how it will fit around its surroundings?\n2\nSo I\'d say I\'d say.\n2\nIs it like a lot like throughout the whole project cause you\'re constantly having to show your change \nplans and how they fit on the on the site so?\n2\nYeah, I see.\n1\nAnd how long, roughly, are the sessions?\n1\nSo is it just going and download the data?\n1\nI mean the map and like would you say less than five or five to 10?\n2\nUM, what for the?\n2\nSo basically the the course is quite so the course is all.\n2\nLike sort of.\n2\nPortfolio hand INS.\n2\nSo a lot of the time it will just be.\n2\nSo we get like one design studio week, which is when you\'re in all day.\n2\nBut when I use the maps would be when I\'m working on my project like at.\n2\nLike home, so I wouldn\'t say there\'s like a specific amount of time.\n2\nIt\'s just sort of when I\'m, like, working on my project, if I need to use it, I will sort of thing.\n2\nIt\'s not really like.\n2\nI\'ll I\'ll sort of just go on it.\n2\nWhen I when I need to sort, I use it.\n2\nYeah, quite a.\n2\nLot throughout the whole the.\n2\nWhole project if that makes sense.\n1\nYeah, I see about the frequency.\n1\nAnd just to have an idea of your session length.\n1\nSo for example per one use like, how long would you stay on the website?\n2\nOhh OK.\n2\nProbably it wouldn\'t take me. It would probably be like 5-5 ish to 10 minutes, but I\'d maybe be on it to \nget get stuff ready to print and then but then that could be that could be every every week or so that I\'m \ngoing on to like regenerate, sort of.\n2\nMaps and stuff, but quite often once I\'ve once I\'ve been on it to get like my maps, I\'ll just use that to like \ntrace over certain things.\n2\nSo it\'s a good like resource to have like printed out sort of at the start start of a project to then like come \nback to.\n2\nThat, yeah.\n1\nOK, got it.\n1\nPerfect.\n1\nSo I think I\'ve got everything that I needed more.\n3\nSo thank you. So.\n1\nMuch for coming through the interview today, we are one bit like a bit overtime.\n1\nI hope that is OK.\n2\nNo, actually I\'m not.\n2\nDoing anything?\n1\nAll right.\n1\nSo thank you so much again.\n1\nAnd yeah, you really gave me a lot of information and that was really helpful for everything that you \nsaid.\n2\nYou can always.\n2\nYou can always e-mail me if there\'s anything you forgot to ask.\n1\nOK. OK, that\'s good.\n2\nSorry about my.\n2\nCamera keep my computers just having my car.\n2\nJust keeps going on and off.\n1\nYeah, that\'s that\'s fine.\n1\nI think we have like a really good conversation going.\n1\nThank you.\n1\nOK.\n2\nThank you very much for.\n2\nTeaching me about the different things.\n1\nYeah, of course.\n1\nAnd if you had any questions in terms of like the using and like whatever, you can always talk to me for \nanything and if there\'s anything I can help with in the future just yeah.\n1\nAsk me anytime.\n2\nThank you very much.\n1\nYeah, alright, I\'ll let you go on with your day now.\n1\nSo, yeah, we\'ll keep in touch.\n1\nThank you so much.\n2\nThank you very much.\n2\nYeah, thanks.\n"\n\nBegin!'}CHAT MESSAGE: {'role': 'system', 'content': 'The interview transcript is a conversation between the interviewer and a participant who is an architecture student.
